Ken & Jeff,

Each year I attend the Enron Management Conference the more I realize that 
the daily leadership and vision that the Office of the Chairman provides is 
what allows us to meet and exceed our goals. That leadership and vision in 
turn empowers every employee to do their job and that empowerment translates 
into continued success. That is what make Enron so unique in the global 
marketplace. Thank you for making this such a great company to work for.

Subject:??????? 2001 U.S. Open 

The U.S. Open golf? tournament will be held at Southern Hills Country Club in 
Tulsa next June 11-17. 

With few exceptions the OPEN is never held this far south, thus making the 
event very accessible to those of us in the Dallas area. This will mark the 
3rd Open to be held at SHCC.

I've been asked to assist in the Corporate Hospitality for the event. Because 
of this it is possibly to offer to your clients an invitation to one of the 
world's preeminent sporting events. To see it live , to watch the drama 
unfold in person, is an unforgettable moment. This is one reason why 
companies want to secure a corporate hospitality package. Before I put the 
word out in the Dallas market (and they will sell out soon) I wanted clients 
of MHBT to have the first shot. (I think this is a fair privilage)

The tickets to the event are sold out already, so the only way to gain access 
is via a hospitality package. They aren't cheap but the chance to have a U.S. 
Open so close might never happen again. Prices are from? $28,500 to $150,000. 
These prices range from a table in a furnished, shared pavilion to an 
exclusive environment. 

If you have anyone you think might be interested please let me know and I 
will be happy to visit with them and describe all the amenities associated 
with each option. 

These started to go on sale in the Tulsa marketplace recently and several 
options are SOLD OUT, including a few over $ 500,000.

Since demand is so high and space is limited I will hold off a week before 
making non-MHBT clients aware of this opportunity of a lifetime.

Take advantage of getting your best clients into the 2001 U.S. Open.

It would be helpful if Jeff could give me a sound bite to headline his 
discussion for the group.  One obvious area of interest is how Enron has 
transformed itself over the last ten years to the P/E ratio of 50+ we see 
today.  Another area of interest would be Enron's perspective of free

which meet monthly, so I can continue to raise awareness of Enron's 
businesses and generally network.   At each lunch meeting which lasts around 
two hours, one of the CEOs makes an informal 20 minute speech on a current 
business subject of their choice and then a discussion follows.

The group has asked if you would like to chair the meeting in September 2001 
on a date of your choice.  At the end of this note there is a list of the 
current membership.  I have been to one meeting and only around a third 
attended.

Please let me know if you are able to commit time to this.  There is no 
problem if you decline.

only us with battery powered lap tops clogging things up.

Everything ok here, so far.  Got a pretty good shake.  Was out in the
streets for a couple of hours, with everyone else.  My neighborhood up on
solid rock, so things looked mostly ok.  Lots of old and bad construction
here; stones in the street.  One upper floor (abandoned) apartment half a
block from here collapsed and much debris in the stereets.  No apparent
injuries, however, in my neighborhood.  Unfortunately, other areas not so
lucky.  Saw 6.7 estimate for Izmit, the center, here (one place I passed had
a genertor and had a tv out for everyone to see).  Passed women praying, men
reading Koran, most just huddled in groups talking. Strange being in the
middle of it all with limited ability to communicate.  Know a few folks in
neighborhood and we had a few basic chats, though its amazing how much I
learned even from them.  Already knew the Turkish word for earthquake, which
is depram (revolution is devrim) and came in handy.

A few seagulls just went by and I think a neighbor down stairs up and about;
mistook that comotion for an aftershock.  A little rattled myself; much like
after SF quake.  I think memory of that still deep seeded in my
subconscious.

Again, this new technology amazes.  Better get off and save my battery.  May
need it.

Thanks for the note.  It was good to see your messages there.  I'll send
this to the rest of the family, but if they call tell them I'm ok and
worried about them worrying about me.

Love,

Mark

Jeff,

Have we explored the possibility of a broadband partnership with the Disney 
Corporation? I watched an interview the other night with Michael Eisner, and 
he said several times during the interview that Broadband held the future for 
delivery of Disney's entertainment products, but Disney is still waiting for 
the broadband infrastructure and bandwidth to be developed.

Blockbuster has had several meetings with Universal to obtain rights to

agreement to license product for both VHS/DVD rentals and the video on demand 
offering.

The negotiations have stalled because Universal has not been willing to sign 
any long-term agreements without Vivendi's support.

Blockbuster has refused to renew their agreement with Universal for VHS/DVD 
rentals until Universal agrees to grant digital VOD rights.  This will be 
detrimental to both parties.

We would like for Vivendi to communicate to Universal that they would support 
a VOD agreement between Universal and Blockbuster for digital content 
rights.  A conversation with Mr. Messier on this topic would be appreciated.

Kevin,

Many thanks for agreeing to speak at our YPO session on April 24, 2001, in
Houston.  The meeting will be held at Enron Broadband Services' network
equipment staging building, which is close to downtown.  We anticipate
attendance of about 100 people.

Breakfast will begin at 7:30 a.m., and the program will run from 8:15 a.m.
to 10:15 a.m.  The subject is ""New Trends in Technology and Venture
Capital.""  You will be on a panel discussion with two other venture
capitalists.  I expect the tone will be highly informal, but I will
schedule a conference call (probably in early March) to provide more
details and specific topics of interest.

Again, Kevin, thank you.  I look forward to seeing you in April.

Jeff asked me to let you know that he really appreciates this opportunity, 
but his time in the office is at such a premium right now due to his heavy 
travel schedule, it would be difficult at best to work them in.  He has 
turned down several invitations to join boards because he just can't commit 
the time.  So, while he is flattered by their interest, if and when Mr. 
Quackenbush calls we will decline.

It was nice talking to you.  Glad to hear all is well.

Subject: Luminant



Jeff,

Great to see Enron and you doing so well.  Congratulations on the -belated-
CEO ship, the blowout first quarter,
and the recent piece in Bloomberg.

Since we last met Luminant has done a important and impactful work for Enron
(EES, Enron Networks, Global
Sourcing, Broadband among others).  The Oasis and the Websource Intranet
sites are examples of the results of
this work.  Phillippe recently selected Luminant as one five integrators
that Enron will use going forward.

David Quackenbush, Luminants COO, has been personally involved in leading
the work at Enron.  He and
Jim Corey Luminant's CEO would like to have the opportunity of meeting with
you, bringing you up to date
on the work, and inviting you to consider joining the Luminant board.

I am no longer affiliated with Luminant but David asked me to let you know
of their interest.  He will be
following up and seeing if there will be an opportunity for you to meet with
them.

Regards,

Gil Marmol

How fun about Suleyman's fabric samples.  Hope they aren't the last
straw that broke the camel's back.  (Oh yeah, no camels here in Turkey;
for reference, Turkey's southern coast same latitude as SF.)  It would
be great if you two could work together.  I really like Suleyman and if
you could help him get into US market it would be a coup for him.  And,
maybe, you and Jeff will get to Turkey!  By the way (which, by the way,
happens to be Suleyman's favorite transitional phrase] Suleyman very
informal; so don't be afraid to get into an extended dialogue with him,
in which you ask a lot of preliminary questions.   Anyway, it would be
good for his English.

Thinking of you ""up north"" very nice.  Guess the lakes are still socked
in, but beautiful and pristine.  I spent the day in one of Istanbul's
sprawling, slapped together neighborhoods, where a lot of refugees from
the Balkins have settled over the years.  Recently, it was the site of
PKK (i.e. Kurdish] riots.  Wanted to see it.  Impressive bit of
improvising; a testimony to we humans' endless ability to adapt and make
lives for ourselves.  Think about what Istanbul's been through.  In 1970
its population was about 1.5 million.  Now its approaching 15 million,
and most of the new comers are dirt poor folks moving in from the
countryside.  It's slapped together, but works pretty damn well.  Bravo!

I guess a bomb went off nearby and someone was killed.  Always a few
folks looking for the quick reconciliation of irreconcilable, competing
differences.

All the above pretty vague; a writer's dilemma is to make it live for
the reader.  But there's just so much ""stuff"" that makes up any given
piece of reality, and its ultimately in the eye of the beholder anyway.
This is some thing I've set out to try and do; to get my arms around a
bit of everything!  A dwarfing, humbling endeavor; like trying to single
handedly to capture all the water from a ruptured dam.

More later.  Good luck with all you do.

Love,

Mark

Mr. Kenneth Lay
Chairman
Enron Corporation
1440 Smith Street
Houston, Texas 77002

Dear Mr. Kenneth Lay:

This brief note concerns an innovative business development opportunity in
the rapidly expanding field of B2B eProcurement/e-commerce.  I am trying to
initiate a system to fully integrate an industry that is fragmented and in
need of adding scalable 'process' efficiencies.  This will require
substantial resources that are not available to me. These resources would be
less significant to a company like Enron Corporation.  However the upside
potential would, I believe, be significant to your corporation. The risk
reward ratio in this marketplace favors the upside potential significantly.
This market is ripe for innovation because of the fundamental need to
improve product and service delivery in a cost effective and timely manner.
The process has already begun but will require a critical mass player that
can deliver open-market eProcurement.  The process related savings alone
will be approximately $11 billion annual when an effective supply chain
system is implemented. The timing is critical since in the next 18- 36
months the winners and losers would have already lined up for success and
failure.  A linchpin is needed and it could well be Enron.  I have little
doubt that Enron could do the job and become the stand-alone leader in this
field.

I am writing to Enron Corporation to determine your potential interest in a
very large global marketplace that is poised for transformation and
transition.  This marketplace is currently valued in excess of $300 billion
annual worldwide with high profit margins as well as large continuing
revenue growth rates in excess of 10% annually. There are buy and sell side
opportunities for revenues as well as a transactional fee opportunity.

What I am proposing would be the critical next innovative step to enter a
new level of global sourcing, purchasing, risk management and distribution
for this industry.

I realize the vagueness and brevity of my comments but without an existing
level of confidentiality I cannot expand these thoughts.  If you have
interest in taking one additional step to determine if my strategic concept
has merit please let me know.

Best regards,

John Manfredonia

Your letter was wonderful.  I was ""transported"" to Illinois and the condo,
and got a nice glimpse of your life there.  Thanks.

I hope you get a chance (or got a chance) to read Tom's and my
correspondence.  I mentioned more than once how fun it was that Tom seemed
as excited as I was.  What a rare and special happening it all was,
especially for me in that Tom was so involved.  And what a great thing this
e-mail gadget is, and that we were ALL able to experience it more or less
simultaneously.

I don't know if you kept a copy of the Perspective section, but your can see
(generally) the area where I live in the picture of Sancta Sophia on the
first page.  If you look in the upper left-hand corner you'll see a finger
of water.  That's the Golden Horn.  (To its left, starting roughly directly
above the Sancta Sophia is the Bosphorus.)  The bridge that you see crossing
the Golden Horn (we're still in the upper left hand corner) is the Galata
Bridge.  Just above the bridge, approximately half an inch on the page is
the blur of buildings where the Galata Tower and my place are.  I live in a
neighborhood called Galata (though the sub-neighborhood is called Kuledibi).
  I'll be bringing more clear pictures, but that's a start.

It IS amazing to think you all moved to condo nearly 22 years ago.  Its also
amazing to think we all moved to Illinois only some 12 years before that.
It seems like those 12 years were a lot longer than the 22 since.  Time is
cruel, I think.  Your initial experience of cold, discomfort, rang a bell
for me too.  When I moved in here it was also middle of winter (although
Istanbul winters not quite as bad as Illinois winters; more like New York I
think).  Had very little furniture (i.e. nothing really).  Ismail and I did
bag a bed and, as I half-mentioned in the article, he and his wife lent an
excellent comforter and another blanket to me.   I rely on heaters here, as
no centralized heating.  At that time, along with the bed, I had bought a
gas heater, which you're not supposed to use at night (in case there's a
leak).  So the first few nights I buried my head under the blankets against
the freezing temperatures.   Since then, have fully equipped the place (e.g.
alos now have an electric heater, which you can use at night) and am ready
(clothes and everything) for next winter.  (Also will pick up a few more
things while I'm in SF.)   All this said, wouldn't have done it any other
way.  Feel I paid a few dues and am better acclimated for the experience.

Life is considerably harder here than in America, but the good life not
inaccessible.  There is everything from Marks & Spencer to McDonalds.   I,
despite living on about $600 to 700 a month, live well and better than most.
  I calculate that, provided you don't go too far up the scale, most things
are a half to a third what they cost in SF. (Toothpaste, by the way -- even
Crest -- is here in spades.)

Have you gotten a chance to talk to Jeff about his visit?

More later, and a lot of that in person.  Thanks again for the note and
sending along the article.

Love,

Mark

Thanks for your reply on the action plan. Regarding your concern of timing, 
we expect Mtg 1 to be in early/mid Febr, Mtg 2 - mid/late Febr, Mtg 3 - late 
Febr, and Mtg 4 - early March. Our biggest hurdle will likely be scheduling 
of interviews with the 10 candidates over a period of 1-2 days - if we are 
successful here we should have no trouble meeting the proposed time

Lisa, action plan looks good; only concern is over what time frame will this 
take place. Based on my conversation with Jeff, he wanted to have finalist to 
Mayor Brown towards the end of February or early March. That seems somewhat 
aggressive based on action plan.

Jeff,
 

I'd like to introduce you to?our company?and set-up a?one-hourconference 
call?and discussion with you?and/or?someone you?trustto evaluate?this 
opportunity.

iSpheres Corporationisco-founded by the Chairman of  Computer Science 
Department at California Institute of Technology.

iSpheres enables dynamic arbitrage opportunities in commodities  trading. 
With iSpheres, trading firms wrap applications like steel  marketplaces, 
energy marketplaces, demand planning systems, and production  planning 
systems as components, and derive additional business value by  monitoring 
these components for real time interdependent events and then  reacting to 
those?composite events  based on business rules.

iSpheres provides a software framework for developing and deploying these  
loosely-coupled Web Services or Meta-Applications. These applications are  
assembled from multiple components, each of which was previously itself an  
application and data source, to enable new business processes. 



For example, a $22 billion investment bank uses the iSpheres Meta  
Application Framework,?to  detect and react to interdependent market events. 
This enables them to optimize  and automate the acquisition and response to 
relevant dynamic?events in  their Market Intelligence information 
environment. 

The build out of the Internet and the rapid  deployment of eBusiness 
applications over last several years has established the  need and created 
the ability to build and deploy loosely-coupled Web Services or  Meta 
Applications. 

Please advise, otherwise I'll  follow up with you in 3-5 days.

Unfortunately, he does not have any planned trips to Europe within the next 
couple of months, though that may change after the first of the year.  If, 
however, Sr. Miranda has any plans to be stateside, I would be happy to 
arrange a time for the two of them to meet.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

As you may know, I have (somewhat reluctantly) decided to resign from Enron.  
For some time now, I have wanted to take some time off, and had asked Whalley 
about the possibility for a six month unpaid, unvested sabbatical.  Primarily 
for reasons of precedence, he was unwilling to pursue this option, which, 
while it is disappointing to me, I accept.

The purpose of this note is twofold.

First, I would like to thank you for making this company the great place it 
is today, and for giving me the opportunity to have a great career here.  I 
will forever look upon my nine plus years with Enron fondly.

Second, I would like to ask you as the administrator of the 1997 Long Term 
Incentive Plan to allow me to explore opportunities in the venture capital 
community without triggering non-compete provisions with regard to future 
payouts.  I very much enjoyed my brief role in venture capital, and have some 
very good contacts in that area here in New York.  Since NetWorks decided to 
cease operations in that business earlier in the year, I should not think 
that Enron would view anything I might do there as competitive, especially if 
I were not working directly in the energy space with an Enron competitor.

At present, I am planning to spend my time at least through the summer 
enjoying, and travelling with, my family.  I have nothing planned 
professionally as of yet, but wanted to take the opportunity to drop you this 
note while I might still be viewed positively (I hope that's not too 
presumptuous!).

Please let me know your thoughts on this non-compete provision as I would not 
wish for anything to be awkward for us going forward.

Again Jeff, thanks for many great memories, and as an Enron shareholder, keep 
up the great work!

The IBM meeting on Monday at 12:30pm in Houston (49C1) is an informal working 
session meeting for the EBS/IBM ASP team rather than a major checkpoint 
meeting.  Therefore, you definitely do not need to attend.  However, you are 
certainly welcome to drop by at any time.  A few morale words about the 
importance of the effort and the size of the joint opportunity with IBM in 
the ASP space are always welcome if you get a chance to come by.

Jeff:  I got a call from Perminder Bindra on Saturday.  He says that the IBM 
team assigned to EBS is extremely excited.  His concern is that there are 
other ASP efforts with other companies going on in IBM, and he fears that the 
""normal"" IBM noise level around these efforts could slow us down (our goal is 
an agreement this quarter).  So if you can stress our need for speed in your 
call with Sam P. tomorrow, that would be helpful.  I am hoping that IBM will 
treat EBS as the top ASP-related partnership that they develop.  Thanks for 
your help.  

  Best regards.

Dear Mr. Skilling:

My name is Tony Kishindo and I am the Senior Market Analyst for DeWolff
Boberg and Associates. I am approaching you with hopes of scheduling some
time on your calendar for an introductory meeting between yourself and my
Vice President, Scott Bein.

The meeting is 45 minutes long and we are not looking for any sort of
commitment or decision at this point. We realize you may not be considering
the services of an outside resource, now or in the foreseeable future. We
non-the-less would appreciate the privilege of meeting with you, determining
the compatibility of our two firms, and earning a place in your Rolodex.
Regardless of the outcome of this meeting, we sincerely appreciate your
kindness and courtesy.

We offer our clients guaranteed process improvement and operations cost
reduction. We guarantee a 20% - 30% increase in production in as little as 8
months. The reason the results are so quick is because we are not technology

blanket when it comes to process improvement. Please feel free to visit our

have a few weeks of peace before someone will start working for 2004.
      The poles have been swamped today and I guess they expect the biggest
vote in the last 40 years.

     I am glad the election is nearly over------after almost 2 years I have
heard enough.
      I got a new tooth inlay this morning and then voted about 10:45 and
already our precinct had had over 180 voters--your mother was one as she went
before she went to the store.  I don't know who she voted for as yet. I was
thinking of putting up some cute sign like (Monica says ""Back Bill""); (Nader
says ""A vote for me is a vote for Bush""); (Be sure to get behind the right
Bush);(Gore is a Kunkle Head); or (Gore - Gore).  However I decided to put my
halo back on.  You realize I am joking of course.
      I watched the Northwestern-Michigan game last saturday-it had to be the
most exciting college game I have ever seen.  NW lost the ball on downs when
their star runner (he had gained 268 yards running) dropped a pass in the
endzone with no one within 10 yards.  All Michigan had to do was run the
clock down (1:45 left in game) so I turned to ESPN to try to get a Lehigh
score ( I finally did) and I never went back to the NW-Mich game.  I learned
just as I turned the radio off to sleep about 8 hours later that NW had
recovered a fumble and scored on a pass to win 54-51.  NW had beaten
Minnesota the week before on a Hail Mary pass  of 50 yards on the last play
of the game.   Incidentally Lehigh had beaten Colgate 20-14 and they are now
9-0.
     I know you are looking forward to seeing Calvin.  I wish I could be a
mouse to see that meeting. I had better leave now.  Your Mother said I should
send her love.  I add my love to that.  DAD

Judy Lay Allen, an associate of yours on the Federal Reserve board, spoke 
with Joannie Williamson today regarding my desire to interview at Enron.

I am a graduate of Princeton University with two years experience in 
financial modeling and communications.   Towards assessing my skill set 
relative to peers, I took and received a 740 on my GMAT.  I have also 
interned in a gas exploration company and am familiar with the industry; 
likewise, I have worked with clients in telecommunications and am aware of 
the work Enron is doing in the bandwidth trading/pooling field.

I am aware of Enron's executive training/business analyst programs and am 
highly interested in exploring opportunities therein.  I am in Houston 
through Friday evening and, given the short notice, would be grateful for any 
opportunity to meet with the appropriate person any time Thursday or Friday.

I look forward to interviewing and applying my experience at Enron.

My tenant, who was excellent, is moving out at end of September, so will be

Subject: Additional PRC Reps and Attending the PRC


We have received numerous requests from individuals in the business units who 
either want to add someone to the PRC Committee or who want to have someone 
attend the Associate and/or Analyst PRC meetings because they do not have a 
representative on the Committees.  

Unfortunately, it is not possible to add additional PRC Reps at this time 
because all of the Associates and Analysts have been divided between the 
existing PRC Reps.  Additionally, as you are aware, the PRC meetings are next 
week, December 12th & 13th and there is not enough time to gather 
information.  We will, however, be reducing the number of Associates and 
Analysts that each PRC Rep is representing and will need several additional 
Reps. If you have individuals that should be nominated please send the names 
to Terry Bosien.  The parameters that were used for the initial appointments 
were as follows:

The person must be a well-respected individual who is nominated/approved by 
the Office of the Chair of the Operating Company
The Associate PRC Reps are vice presidents
The Analyst PRC Reps are directors /sr. directors

The level of the PRC reps on the committee is important to adhere to for 
several reasons.  First, Jeff wanted individuals at these levels to gain 
additional exposure in the organization and be involved in activities beyond 
their business unit boundaries.  Additionally, it potentially places the PRC 
Rep in an awkward position and they may feel undue pressure in the meeting if 
they are required to disagree with a more senior individual.  

We have also received request from individuals wanting to ""observe"" the 
meeting.  As in the MD/VP process, individuals are not allowed to just 
observe if they are not a part of the Committee.  We attempted to have the 
major units represented, however, it is not possible to have every division 
represented.   Jeff Skilling spent over an hour with the PRC Reps explaining 
why the individuals selected as PRC Reps, rather than the Associates' & 
Analysts' managers, should be the ones to represent the Associates & Analysts 
in the PRC.  He also reiterated the importance of the PRC Reps' 
responsibilities which was to (1) meet with the Associates' and Analysts' 
managers;  (2) gather as much information as possible and (3) advocate 
objectively for the individual.
Also, if there are too many individuals in the room it is difficult or 
impossible to come to a consensus, which has been the case in the past.  

I hope this is helpful.  If business units find this is not acceptable, they 
should seek approval for their attendance from Jeff Skilling.

Thanks for your understanding, cooperation and support.

Charlene

Subject:??????? 2001 U.S. Open 

The U.S. Open golf? tournament will be held at Southern Hills Country Club in 
Tulsa next June 11-17. 

With few exceptions the OPEN is never held this far south, thus making the 
event very accessible to those of us in the Dallas area. This will mark the 
3rd Open to be held at SHCC.

I've been asked to assist in the Corporate Hospitality for the event. Because 
of this it is possibly to offer to your clients an invitation to one of the 
world's preeminent sporting events. To see it live , to watch the drama 
unfold in person, is an unforgettable moment. This is one reason why 
companies want to secure a corporate hospitality package. Before I put the 
word out in the Dallas market (and they will sell out soon) I wanted clients 
of MHBT to have the first shot. (I think this is a fair privilage)

The tickets to the event are sold out already, so the only way to gain access 
is via a hospitality package. They aren't cheap but the chance to have a U.S. 
Open so close might never happen again. Prices are from? $28,500 to $150,000. 
These prices range from a table in a furnished, shared pavilion to an 
exclusive environment. 

If you have anyone you think might be interested please let me know and I 
will be happy to visit with them and describe all the amenities associated 
with each option. 

These started to go on sale in the Tulsa marketplace recently and several 
options are SOLD OUT, including a few over $ 500,000.

Since demand is so high and space is limited I will hold off a week before 
making non-MHBT clients aware of this opportunity of a lifetime.

Take advantage of getting your best clients into the 2001 U.S. Open.

speak to Jeff (for the ever-popular ""5 minutes"") about his company.  Jeff has 
asked that you follow up with this gentleman.  His phone number is

(Karen, I'm copying you in the event you have any information on Mr. Alphonse

I just had to write to tell you about your wonderful employees! Yes,
Enron Field is the most comfortable, beautiful Baseball Stadium I've
ever been in, but your employees make it great!

I was at yesterdays Inaugural Game (March 30, 2000). Everyone with an
Enron Shirt had a smile on their face and a ""Hello"" on their lips. My
husband and I had to purchase our tickets through a ticket company, but
the couple next to us got theirs' at COST. How? Well they said they were
in line at Ticketron when she heard everyone talking about the Inaugural
Game at Enron Field. An Enron Employee answered all this lady's (my
seat neighbor at the game) questions and OFFERED her AT COST to sell her
two of her 8 tickets (she said this is what Enron gave to her).
If that wasn't enough, a kind gentleman (wearing an Enron Shirt) was
standing in the concession line (very long lines up in the mezzanine
section), and gently mentioned to me where the line started. After I

Jeff, 

I will be heading out to Macerich's offices to meet Macerich's management 
team. At that meeting, we will be discussing the outsource and the future 
relationship between the companies.  He would also like me to speak to his 
direct reports about change management and other cultural characteristics of 
Enron.  However, he would really like you to provide a presentation on the 
same general topics to the Macerich Company Conference in June.  He has heard 
you speak and believes your approach and perspective can benefit the 
conference.

Obviously, these guys are an important relationship and reference for our 
commercial and real estate business.

Let me know your interest.

Angela - thanks for making time to have dinner with us on Wednesday:  it
was great to see you.

As Art mentioned, since the time we have started working with you, we have
made frequent references to our operating teams about Enron's
accomplishments in the areas of customer excellence and employee
satisfaction.  More generally, we've held Enron out as an example of a
highly accomplished company in all the areas Macerich is currently focusing
on as an organization (operational integration, customer orientation,
scalability, change leadership, and strategic focus).

All of that being said, we would be extremely appreciative of an
opportunity to have either Jeff Skilling or Dave Delainey speak at either
of these conferences.  In any event, we're delighted that you would make an
effort to see if this can be put together.

Relative to upcoming Macerich events, there are two scheduled:

(1) University of Notre Dame Executive Education Program, May 7 - 9 in
South Bend.  The curriculum is centered on change leadership and strategic
thinking (officially ""Enhanced Leadership and Strategy in the New
Economy"").  Attendees include our Executive Team (Art, David, Rick,Tom, Ed,
and Larry Sidwell) and our Operating Team (17 SVPs).  There is also a
round-table discussion scheduled with our Board on May 9.

(2) Macerich's Company Conference, June 4 - 7 in Park Cities, Utah.  The
emphasis of the conference will be on our ""e-Business Transformation"" (more
specifically on becoming wholly integrated across functional roles,
customer facing, and highly scalable) and capturing value in our ""Value
Network"" (relationships we have with retailers, partners, vendors,
shoppers, etc.)  The attendees for this event include the same people at
UND as well as our managerial professionals from the malls and our
corporate offices (about 250 people, total).

Let me know if you need any additional background or information.

Eric

I am a YPOer in the Rebel Chapter who was given your name from an IOS source
as someone who could potentially help in this situation. As background, I
sent this IOS request out last week:

Description of Situation
My highway construction company has been negatively impacted by price
volatility in energy prices (fuel, natural gas, and asphalt cement). We
offer long term, fixed price contracts to our clients yet must purchase our
petroleum and energy-related products at spot market prices. Thus we are
exposed to significant price adjustment risks.

Type of Feedback Requested:
Does anyone have experience using commodity contracts as an arbitrage
strategy to offset the risks of potential price volatility in the energy
sector? If so, do you have specific recommendations for how we should
proceed?

Thank you for any information you can offer.

As I have investigated this further, I find no one in this industry (highway
construction) who is purchasing futures to mitigate their energy cost
exposure. I have spoken with folks who are doing this in the building supply
sector with lumber futures.

Do you have any thoughts or suggestions in this matter? Any input would be
greatly appreciated.

Many thanks,

Wow.  What can I say.  Will it help?  It covers about thirty months of
rent here (and I have a nice place), and makes it nearly certain that I
have the wherewithall to hang in there long enough to give this writing
thing an umitigated shot.  Thanks so very much.

Thanks also for for the kind words in your letter about appreciating
getting my little blurbs.  That means a lot to me.

Your letter capped what was one of my best days here (and I have had a
lot of great days here).  Have met a ""harika [wonderful]"" Turkish woman,
and had just spent a fine evening with her when I came home and found
your letter.  Her name is Sukran (pronounced ""Shoo-kron"").  More about
her later.  I have to admit that I cried a bit after I opened your
letter; the culmination of a lot of fantasitic feelings.

It would be great if you got over here.  It's really an endlessly
facinating place, and I think I'm becoming a prtty good guide.  (Also,
Sukran should be helping my Turkish a lot.)  Let me know as far ahead of
time as possible so I can sure you have the best choices of hotels.

I know my blurbs suggest greyness, but that's the most interesting color
for me.  As I mentioned in my last e-mail to you, I'm having the time of
my life.  Indeed, today is the first real day of spring here (though it
may be a false one [ it snowed pretty hard just two weekends ago]) and I
actually sat out in the sun on the porch next to my place and studied
Turkish and prepared my next English lessons.

I recently sent Kristin an ""introduction to Istanbul"" e-mail (we just
got in touch by e-mail after the holidays); you may want to ask her to
run off a copy for you (assuming she saved it).

Hope you're enjoying your work.  Let me know what else is happening in
your life.  Thanks again for everything.

Love,

Mark

quake and it being August, my teaching schedule is slimer than usual.  (I
had already been keeping it pretty slim [15-20 hours per week, including
preparation time].)  So I only had to work in the mornings this week.  On
Tuesday, I spent the afternoon on a first draft, probably 5 or so hours
total.  I wasn't that happy with it, as I spent too much of it synthisizing
what I had been reading about the big picture (after all, this was for a
newspaper).  That night I meet with Ismail (who, by the way, is a
journalist) and he encouraged me to write it more like I had been writing
the other things I've written since I've been here.  He was right, though I
already knew it.  (Your commments also brought this point home.)  I went
home that night and worked it over some more, until 3:00 or so in the
morning, then again the next day in the afternoon.  What does that add up
to?  The writing, maybe 12 or so hours, with some thinking and dsicussion in
between.

Hope Dad and Sue get a chance to follow this all in Alaska. There are
probably Interent Cafes there. Mom, I guess, can read it in Sunday's
paper(!).

By the way, how is mom?  With dad doing all the writing from home I don't
get a strong imression about how she is. (I had asked earlier if everything
was all right, but got no reponse to that question.)  Is everyting all
right?

More later, as I want to get this off in case you're still there (though
Ihipe you've gone home for some shut eye).  I have to sign off in about 20
minutes and get ready for my class.

Your little brother

Eric Shaw's team has learned that an investigation has been initiated by th=
e=20
Turkish military to expose and eliminate corruption in the Turkish energy=
=20
sector.

On January 6, the military took seven energy sector bureaucrats into custod=
y.=20
In the following days, other officials from TEA? (the electricity generatio=
n=20
monopoly) and the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MENR) and=20
executives from a number of Turkish companies were also taken into custody.=
=20

While many of the bureaucrats and executives have been released, a leaked=
=20
report from the military investigators suggests that the operation is wide=
=20
ranging and may ultimately target the Minister of Energy and Natural=20
Resources and other senior energy sector bureaucrats and businessmen.=20

Enron Implications

Trakya - One Turkish newspaper has reported that Enron=01,s  478 MW Trakya =
power=20
project was being investigated.  This has not been reported anywhere else. =
=20
Because the power price at Trakya has been the target of criticism in the=
=20
past, we are not surprised by this report. Although an investigation is=20
always a possibility, other than the one newspaper report, there has been n=
o=20
indication, official or otherwise, that an investigation is planned or=20
underway.
=20
GAMA - It has also been reported that the wife of Gorkhan Yardim, the Gener=
al=20
Manager of BOTA? (the natural gas monopoly), works at GAMA, our Turkish=20
partner in the Trakya project, and that his expensive car was a gift from=
=20
GAMA. GAMA has told us, and Yardim has defended himself publicly by saying,=
=20
that his wife has been working at GAMA since 1993, long before Yardim had=
=20
risen to his current position of power at BOTA?, and that the car was not a=
=20
gift from GAMA. It is worth noting, however, that there have been a number =
of=20
newspaper reports questioning GAMA=01,s role in a controversial gas marketi=
ng=20
deal being undertaken by their TurRusGas joint venture with Gazprom and BOT=
A?.

Outlook

It is still not clear how or when this investigation will end. In the mediu=
m=20
and long term, this will be good news for Enron and other reputable Turkish=
=20
or foreign companies which have found it difficult to do transparent energy=
=20
deals in Turkey in the past. In the short term, however, it is likely to=20
result in a marked decrease in meaningful activity in the Turkish energy=20
sector, as worried bureaucrats, innocent and guilty, lay low.=20

We will continue to monitor developments, especially with regard to the=20

Dear Mr Jeffrey K Skilling:

With click-through rates plunging all over the World Wide Web, conventional 
wisdom says that Internet portals no longer have a legitimate place in 
consumer marketing plans.

An exclusive analysis by Booz-Allen & Hamilton, however, paints an entirely 
different picture.  True...the role of portals has changed, but the change 
has made them even more potent than before.  Instead of mere gateways, 
portals are centers of content and commerce that draw audiences in the same 
way that large-circulation magazines and successful TV networks do.

Major changes are taking place in terms of banner advertising, search engine 
use, per-click pricing, and the way business is done on the Internet.  But 
the truly amazing aspect of all this is that portals are still changing.  
First they were gateways, now they are destinations...what will the next 
phase be?  And what will it mean to you?

To find the answers to those questions, I suggest that you carefully read 
""The Great Portal Payoff"" by Horacio D. Rozanski and Gerry Bollman in the 
upcoming issue of strategy+business.

When you do, you will see why strategy+business is so eagerly awaited by the 
select group of influential senior executives to whom we regularly send 
complimentary issues.

While we are on the subject, I should mention that our records indicate you 
have been receiving s+b since Jun 16 00.  There is no reason why you cannot 
keep receiving strategy+business absolutely free...but it would be best if 
you make arrangements right now to extend your subscription.

Subject:  Genesis Park


Jeff, I've been meaning to corner you at one of the YPO functions to spend
a
minute discussing a couple of topics.  First and foremost, I wanted to
introduce Genesis Park which is a ""new economy"" investment company that's
been recently founded here in Houston by Paul Hobby, Fred Lummis, Steve
Gibson, Peter Shaper, Bruce Herzog and myself.  Paul and I were hoping to
have an opportunity to spend 30 minutes with you in the next few weeks to
describe in person what we're all about.  And to be clear, we're not
looking
for Enron money, we are raising money from private individuals.  We've
already met with Jay Fitzgerald and Steve Horn to establish the
Enron/Genesis business relationship.

I also wanted to get your views on Enron's approach to oil trading and
whether the Vitol Group presented an opportunity.  Frankly, I think Vitol
is
an excellent acquisition target although the success they've enjoyed in the
last year or two will make it a bit more difficult.  They have an
unbelievable franchise, but they also have some fundamental weaknesses
which
could be exploited to Enron's benefit.  I'm shooting in the dark here but
hopefully it's worth some discussion.

If you can free some time during this busy holiday period to meet, it would
be greatly appreciated.  Paul and I could come to your office, or possibly
you could come to our ""offices"" over on Hermann Park.  We're buying 17
acres
on Hermann Park adjacent to the Park Lane Towers which we plan to develop
into a technology park.  For the time being, we are officing in a high tech
shed on the property!

Please let me know.  Thanks/Neil.

A few months ago we talked about me working for Enron.  I am a long time
friend of John Miller...golfing and social...imagine that.

Though we did not find a position for me in your company things have gone
quite well.  I now have opened an office for Angus Systems Group in Atlanta.


Jeff...your company does a lot of facility stuff and our company is the
expert in web based applications for properties for work requests and
preventive maintenance.  Could you give me the name of the person in your
company that I could show our applications to?

Here is a little about our company and a brochure on a web, wireless and
paperless Tenant Request (work order) solution.

Subject: Congratulations/January Meeting


Dear Jeff,

Congratulations on being named Enron's new Chief Executive Officer.  What an
outstanding and well-deserved accomplishment.

Cary Maguire and Dean Niemi would like to make a trip to Houston in January
to visit with you if your schedule permits.  Cary is particularly interested
in touring the trading floor.  Would you please let me know if you would be
willing to meet with them and, if so, when the best time would be?  Thank
you.

Also, Liz Williams, SMU's Treasurer, met with Bart Schachter of Blueprint
several weeks ago.  She said his fund looks like a good opportunity.  She
shared with me that even though SMU is currently over its allocation to
venture and private equity and has therefore slowed down on new commitments,
the University's investment advisor is evaluating Blueprint.  She also told
me that decisions on venture and private equity can often take quite awhile.
I will keep you posted on any further developments that I learn.

Warm regards,

Suzanne

Subject: tent


Elvis,
Woody sent me a note today.  In it he mentioned that he has the old roll
book from the fraternity house.  He said he took it because the young
fellas had no respect for the past.
This reminded me of an idea I had earlier.  I was thinking of the banner
for our tent and thinking of some way of making it clear that it was the
Old Betas tent...and beer.  I was thinking of 'Original House Betas',
'Silver/Grey Betas'(...though I've become a silver-gray, my heart keeps
time and measure... with Beta Theta Pi, to find my highest pleasure.
Samuel N Wilson, Hanover '72) or something like that to distinguish our
tent from the active Beta tent.
I'm sure there are any number of clever titles that accomplish the same
thing....keeping a bunch of young beer guzzling freeloading strangers out
of our fricking tent!
That's all.

Bachtell, an attorney in Utah who is attempting to organize shareholders to 
replace existing management.  Crown has an asphalt oil sand production 
facility in northeast Utah and an asphalt distribution company.  Bachtell 
owns about 4-5% of the stock.  Mr. Wyatt indicated he had a ""small"" holding.  
I indicated that we would consider any proposal that might result in 
salvaging some value from this investment.

We hold convertible preferred and a small amount of common at an original 
cost of $5.5 million in 1997.  Fully converted, our ownership would be 
approximately 25%.  The Company has a net deficit of $21 million and a ""going 
concern"" paragraph in its audit opinion.  We have written down our carrying 
value to nil.

The Company in engaged in an arbitration proceeding against MCN Energy and 
MCNIC Pipeline.  MCNIC has interests in the asphalt assets and is a lender to 
Crown.  MCNIC attempted to foreclose on certain Crown assets and Crown in 
turn counter-sued for $100 million.  The arbitration hearing will be held 
July 23 - August 10.  If Crown obtained an award from the arbitration, some 
value could be restored to our investment.

We will get further information from Bachtell on the details of his plans and 
recommend what position Enron should take in this matter.",SKILLING-J

I heard from Wade that there were a number of questions on Dabhol yesterday 
and I thought it may help if u received a quick update. Over the last 3 days, 
I have met with most key players in GOI and GOM assisted by some very close 
friends of ours. The start of the state assembly session has given some 
politicians and some vested interests an opportunity to raise issues about 
Dabhol in the assembly again, a feature that we have seen every year, at 
about this time, without exception and has led to a number of misleading 
newspaper reports. The usual suspects are behind the latest stirring of the 
pot. 

The facts however are as follows:

1. GOM (at the administrative and political level) and MSEB remain firmly 
behind the project and the commitments to it. They are concerned but at the 
same time looking at proactively working to find a solution. They also 
believe that they may have found one that is agreeable to GOI.

2. After discussions with us on Tuesday, GOM and MSEB are working on a plan  
(thru this weekend) to treat Dabhol as a national asset. The plan involves 
MSEB selling  power from DPC to the central government utility which will 
then pool the power with over 30,000 MW of power that they currently  control 
and sell the power onward to other states. The plan has already been 
discussed at senior levels in the GOI and finds general acceptance. Obviously 
the details are to be worked out and we are proceeding to help GOM put the 
outline together over this weekend in Delhi and GOM will then discuss it with 
MOP on Monday. 

Wade reported that it was felt that the seniormost GOI ministers be apprised  
of the seriousness which with we are viewing this situation. This was already 
done Tuesday.

3. The Indian Lenders to the Dabhol project have met and agreed to a 30 day 
waiver of MSEB delay in payment - agreed subject to review of the situation 
at the end of 6 months. They have also agreed to the Equity transfer - 
subject to lenders counsel confirming that there are no legal issues under 
any of the project contracts. This shows the lender support for continuing to 
move forward and buys us time to put in place the fix we are planning.

4. Ministry of Power has yesterday agreed to support an effort to freeze the 
duties on imported fuel at a lower level of about $12/bbl versus the current 
$35 or so. This will help achieve an immediate reduction in tariff from Phase 
I and make Dabhol more competitive. This proposal is currently with Ministry 
of Finance and our expectation is that they will review it favorably as the 
MOP is taking it up personally.

All signs that I have received in India over the last few days lead me to 
believe that the GOM is committed to solving the Dabhol issues at the 
earliest. While we all have concerns, they seem to be addressable and if the 
current plan is successful, they can  be sorted out within the context of 
current and existing documentation.

I have left names out but they are better discussed on the call that has been 
scheduled for Monday evening India time. Hope that this helps in the meantime.

Since I have been processing the Webley invoices over the last 3 months I've 
have noticed that many of you don't have any or only have very little usage 
on your accounts.   The purpose of this e-mail is to see how many of you want 
to keep your telephone assistant services and who wants to discontinue the 
service, since most of the Webley charges are only service charges and very 
little or no usage.

You might be interested in knowing that a version of the previous was
published in the English language Turkish Daily News here on February 9th.
(I'm still waiting to hear back from some folks in the States.)  Afraid that
it might appear a bit negative about the Turks, I shortened it, taking out
for example my speculation about how Turkish soldiers might treat folks who
outflanked the fence as well as some of my thoughts about why all the
windows had been knocked out.  (I did leave in my thought about
""vindictiveness"" being the justification.)   It still got edited a bit, for
example my use of the word ""invasion"" was changed to ""Peace Operation"",
which is the somewhat euphemistic term it is known by here (which doesn't
not mean I am saying the Turks weren't justified in invading the place).

I'd love to hear your thoughts about it, or any other news that you all
might have.

Hope all goes well.

Mark

Location - at a fire station in a Hispanic Community - exact location will be 
forwarded shortly but estimated distance from ENE office = less than 15 min.

Expect News Conference to last a total of 30 minutes, including Q&A. Jeff 
Skilling will be spokesperson for Selection Committee. However, we will try 
to have as many committee members present as possible. 

Mayor will likely discuss (estimated time = 10 min.):
 - changes that are required at HFD - potential need to bring in an outsider, 
etc...
 - reasoning behind involvement of Enron/Jeff Skilling & formation of 
selection committee - de-politicize the process, etc...

JS should speak about the following (estimated time = 10-15 min.):
 - how he became involved in the process
 - how the committee members were selected
 - who the members are with a brief background on each (We plan to provide a 
bio on each of the committee members as part of the press release)
 - time line for Fire Chief selection 

Q&A (estimated time = 5-10 min.)
 - expect questions along the lines of: Are the meetings going to be open or 
closed?, Outsider vs. Insider related questions...

Please let me know if you have any questions/comments/issues with the above. 
I'll coordinate collection of Bios from Committee members. Anything else I 
can do to help out here?

Great to hear from you.  Things still fine in my vacinity.  Surkan and
family ok, though of course everyone is afraid, worried and sad.  The big
picture is not good.  Looks like the death toll alone will reach several
thousand, the injured over ten thousand.

Power and water back on in most of area in my area, and I believe that is
true throughout city.  Just looking at an amazing chart on TV that shows an
incredible series of some one or two dozen aftershocks, all over 4.O.  The
original one was, according to CNN, 7.8.  Some of the other scenes on the
tube are hard to believe.  I trust you'll get to see a selection of them
back there.

Thanks for the offer of help.  Don't think this disaster will be borne by
everyone, though, as it seems food, drink and everyting else available to
all but those who died.  Still, its hard not to imagine that something this
big in a place who's resources were already stretched won't result in some
serious widespread problems.  So I'll keep you in touch.

Have been composing a note to you in my head, which I will do by hand soon
and send to you with some pictures of your visit here.  Briefly, though, it
was great to see you and I am very happy that you've seen a bit about my
life here.  Enjoyed seeing Kristin and hope she had fun.  Look forward to
seeing her and the other kids soon and meeting Rebecca some day.

Say hey to all, take care and write again soon.

Love,

Mark

Jeff,

How's it going in the world of energy?  I enjoy reading about you and your
adventures. Sounds like you might be having a little fun as well.

Attached is a resume from an acquaintance of mine.  Nice guy and would be
credit to anyone's organization.  Thought you  might forward it to
personnel.

Don't forget you've got a lifetime warranty on the drywall in your house.
My compliments.  Call me if you have any problems.  Also I walked your new
building last week.  Quite impressive, especially what we're having to
build on a tight schedule.  Should really be nice.  If you'd like a
personal tour, let me know.  I'd love to put you in a hardhat and introduce
you to the team that's doing all the work.  Would make a great shot for my
in-house publication and maybe yours as well.

Miss seeing you at our Forum meetings.  WPO is not as much fun as YPO.
Enjoy it while you can!

Hi Stan:

It was good to meet you this morning. I've enjoyed working out with Joel;
he's a good ""kid"" and I can certainly relate to his Midwest roots and Iowa
State background. I grew up on a grain/livestock farm in Gladbrook, Iowa, a
town of under 1,000 people, and did my BS at Iowa State and MBA at Kansas
University.

I'm currently working as Director, Business Development at RedMeteor.com,
an
internet-based energy brokerage company. We compete against Altra Energy,
EnronOnline, InterContinentalExchange and HoustonStreet. We started with
$22
million in venture capital, but need an additional infusion of capital to
build out our business model. I think it's going to be difficult for us to
attract additional funding in this climate, so I'm interested in making a
move to another employer when I find the right fit.

As I mentioned this morning, I've been talking with Conoco recently (my
previous employer for 9 years) as well as Enron's Broadband Services group.
I'm looking for a Houston-based business development position that would
build on my eCommerce experience at RedMeteor or my oil & gas pipeline
operations background. I've also met with Reliant Energy recently although
I
understand they've suspended hiring in their trading/eCommerce groups due
to
the California crisis.

Any suggestions you would have would be appreciated. Thanks for your time.

I've cut and pasted in below a piece that should be published in the Turkish
Daily News (the English language paper here) later this week.  It's a first
person piece about my experience of a Christmas service here last year, a
lot of which you'll recognize from last year.  (Ugh, I'm already repeating
myself and I've just started [though really had no choice, as needed to get
it out before the holiday itself].)  Since this year Christmas again fell
during the Muslim Holy Month of Ramadan, the piece is sort of year neutral.

Happy holidays,

Mark-O

*  *  *

     Christmas Day, Istanbul


     The priest mutters his deeply accented English into the microphone,
which amplifies and further distorts his voice.  His bluntly pronounced
words rebound through the vast, freezing hall of Saint Antoine Cathedral.
They tell a story familiar to me, about the Son of God being sent to earth
to die for our sins.  But here, in the middle of this enormous Muslim City,
the story sounds strange and almost subversive.
     And, indeed, the Christ story is at the center of the great Christian
and Muslim divide.  Muslims accept only that Christ was a prophet sent by
God, rejecting vehemently that Christ is his son.  They see Mohammed's
prophecy, and the Koran, as prompted by the need to correct the mistaken
elevation -- by the Gospel -- of Christ from the flesh to the divine.
     The priest appears relieved to turn things over to an African man who,
in a bizarre contrast to the priest?s gold embroidered robe, is wearing a
big, stuffed yellow ski jacket.  His English is much better as he announces
that we are now to sing a hymn.  The song?s words, handwritten and in
English, are flashed up onto a screen by an overhead projector.  The lyrics
are basic.  There are several identical stanzas that simply invite Jesus ?to
come?.  I grimace slightly when I see that these are followed by a poorly
translated chorus, which asks for the Son of God ""to come will be born in
our heart?.
     I glance over at Ismail, a Muslim friend who has come with me to the
service.  He smiles, gives me a wink.  His English is excellent and I am
sure he notices the mistake.  I look around at the rest of the people in the
sanctuary.  The pews are not even a third full.  This is the first service
of the day, and is completely in English.  It will be followed by an Italian
and a Turkish one.  The crowd at the Turkish service, Ismail tells me, will
overflow into the courtyard in front of the Cathedral, and will consist
mostly of Muslims curious to see a Christmas service.  Apparently some
members of St. Antoine's permanent congregation are angry about this, since
many of them will be unable to find a place to sit.  Some may even being
forced to stand out in the cold.


     Christmas Day, this year, falls within the Muslim holy Month of
Ramadan, during which the faithful are to fast between sunrise and sunset,
or more precisely -- according to the Koran -- between the times one can
discern a white thread from a black one.  (Ramadan is celebrated during the
ninth month of the Muslim calendar, which is a lunar one; in the solar
calendar it occurs 11 days earlier each year.)  My day had started well
before dawn when I was awoken by our neighborhood's Ramadan drummer, who was
roaming the streets pounding his drum and hollering at the top of his lungs.
  Since Ramadan began several days ago, all over Istanbul similar drummers
have been setting out into the streets, some as early as 3 a.m.  A tradition
originating from a time when clocks were less prevalent, their aim is to
rustle the believers up out of bed in time for them to have a meal before
the sun comes up.
     Ramadan is by far the most important religious observance of the year
for Muslims.  Somewhat like the Jewish celebration of Yom Kippur, which some
say influenced it, Ramadan is a period of atonement and forgiveness.  Total
remission of sins can be achieved if one fasts with pure intentions.  I have
been told that in Turkey, which is 98% Muslim, well over 50% of all the
Turks fast during Ramadan.  That estimate is certainly consistent with what
I have seen and heard.  The majority of the Turks I come in contact tell me
they fast.  The streets of Istanbul are normally full of vendors selling all
sorts of food.  There are noticeably fewer of them now and they are
significantly less busy.  During the day some restaurants are closed, many
of the rest all but empty.  I myself have been careful to be respectful and
eat only indoors, avoiding among other things my usual practice of grabbing
a simit (a bagel like round of bread) and piece of fruit in the morning and
eating them on my way to work.


     Ismail leans over and asks if the service is similar to ones in the
States.  I whisper back that I was raised Protestant and had not seen enough
Catholic services in my life to say.  ?Raised? Protestant was really much
too strong a word to use.  My early religious education involved little more
than an hour each Sunday down in the basement of the local Presbyterian
Church (first in Westfield, New Jersey, later in Aurora, Illinois) with my
twin sister Sue.  There, during our Sunday school class, we often struggle
for the entire hour to suppress giggling fits to which we only seemed
susceptible in church.  Sitting now in St. Antoine?s, I check myself to see
if any of those fits still linger, am relieved to discover that none do.
     The priest has returned and is now saying something about light being
shown into the darkness, and about how the darkness was unable to defeat
that light.  The image of a light, tiny but robust, surrounded by infinite
darkness, is a particularly powerful one for me today, especially given that
I am so far from what I am most familiar.
     A new voice -- the priest had been replaced again -- asks us to rise.
The words of ?Come Let Us Adore Him? are projected onto the screen.  I lean
over toward Ismail, whisper that this is a very famous song.  He kids under
his breath that perhaps it?s one of God?s greatest hits.  I smile,
straighten back up, listen to the song begin.
     There is no choir, only a single guitar for accompaniment.  It takes a
while for the congregation?s singing to build up.  Though it never becomes
particularly loud, it is beautiful.  Eventually I join in too.  As if
something ethereal, our voices drift up through the tremendous space that
envelops us, seeming only to just barely penetrate the thick, cold air.  I
am moved by how wonderful our singing sounds and am surprised to feel a
tear, though already ice-cold, in the corner of my eye.  Most of the people
here are Westerners, I suppose, and I wonder how many came like me to be
reminded of home -- a few cold foreigners dwarfed by a Cathedral that is
itself dwarfed by the immense Moslem city surrounding it.  For the first
time since arriving in Istanbul, I feel a bit homesick.
     The song ends.  The priest returns, invites everyone up to take
communion. Thinking that Ismail might find it interesting, I suggest that we
walk to the front of the church to watch.  We do.  But when we get there I
am surprised that our way is blocked by a dozen or so television cameramen,
who have begun filming the ceremony.  I had not seen them before and wonder
where they might have been hiding.
Some, now with the powerful lights attached to their cameras turned on,
swing around and start filming those who have remained in the pews.  An
older woman, who is kneeling and praying, is caught in one of those lights.
The cameraman moves in closer and is soon no more than a couple feet away.
With her eyes closed, the elderly woman continues her praying.  I wonder how
she can concentrate and, indeed, if she can.  But she continues, or at least
pretends to, perhaps seeing it as an act of defiance.
     The cameramen get even bolder and are now moving freely about the
church, filming others at point blank range.  Ismail says he does not want
to be on the evening news and tells me he will meet me outside.  I return to
my seat and watch the end of communion, wrapped up like it is, so
incongruously, in the hectic filming.  And I wonder how God would view all
this, his two most successful religions bumping up against each other in
such an awkward fashion.  Which of the many ways these two religions have
come up with to worship him would he approve of, disapprove?


     This afternoon, in Istanbul, the few Christians families that live here
will be feasting and celebrating with their families and friends, perhaps
exchanging gifts.  Early in the evening, after the blast of the cannon shots
heard all over Istanbul that signal the end of the day's Ramadan fasting,
pious Muslims will sit down to their own post-fast celebratory meal, the
Iftar.  Later still, the mosques will be filled, though mostly by men, where
special Ramadan prayers will be said.  Istanbul itself is remarkable -- at
least to westerners -- for the many domes of its huge Ottoman mosques and
the hundreds of minarets that spike its skyline, as well as the calls to
prayer that pierce its urban din five times each day.
     Yet when the day ends, throughout Istanbul, each of us will fall asleep
under the same black sky.

""In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not."" *

 * Translation from the Bible.

""Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds!
The compassionate, the merciful!
King on the day of reckoning!
Thee only do we worship, and to Thee do we cry for help.
Guide Thou us on the straight path,
The path of those to whom Thou hast been gracious; -- with whom Thou are not
angry, and who go not astray."" **

 ** Translation from the Koran.

Subject: eSpeak Survey: The results are in!


We recently asked you to create an eSpeak ""wish list"" for us.  The response 
was tremendous and, in some cases, very creative.  Your fellow employees 
asked for everyone from Britney Spears to George Bush.  In all, we received 
requests for 61persons outside of Enron to host an eSpeak event.  We thought 
you might like to know who your colleagues find interesting, so we've 
provided a sampling of the suggestions below.  Here are the top ten most 
requested eSpeakers.

10.  Jack Welch, CEO, General Motors 
9.  Scott McNeally, CEO, Sun Microsystems 
8.  Satisfied Enron Customers
7.  Stephen Covey, author, The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People
6.  Oprah Winfrey, talkshow host
5.  General Colin Powell, former Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, U.S.A. 
4.  Alan Greenspan, Chairman, Federal Reserve, U.S.A.
3.  Former U.S. President George Bush 
2.  Bill Gates, CEO, Microsoft 
1.  Texas Governor George W. Bush

While we can't make any promises, we will do our best to bring in at least 
some of these special guests.  If you have any contacts who could help us get 
in touch with these guest speakers, please let us know at ethink@enron.com.  
Everybody needs a little help now and then, even eSpeak.

There were plenty of internal speakers requested, as well.  Those requests 
should be somewhat easier to meet, although scheduling time with some of our 
colleagues can be quite a task!

Thank you all for your participation.

****************************************************

Eurasia Group is pleased to announce a breakfast roundtable in the next in
our Eurasia Forum series:

TURKEY'S POLITICAL STABILITY with TANSU CILLER, FORMER TURKISH PRIME
MINISTER

Discussant: TBD

Chair: Ian Bremmer, President, Eurasia Group

DATE: Friday, 4 May 2001
TIME: 8:30am - 10:00am
PLACE: Eurasia Group Executive Offices
461 Fifth Avenue, 14th Floor (enter on 40th Street)
New York, NY  10017

A public row between the Turkish president and prime minister in
mid-February sparked market turmoil that resulted in an overnight 30%
devaluation in the lira and a crash of the IMF-backed stabilization program.
These events led to the resignations of the central bank governor and
treasury undersecretary and have tested the staying power of the country's
three-party government coalition.  In response to this instability, the
Turkish government appointed former World Bank Vice President, Kemal Dervis,
as the new Minister of Economics in hopes of resuscitating the country's
fledgling economy.

Ciller was elected Prime Minister in June 1993; her True Path party led
several coalition governments until 1996.  After losing her seat in 1996,
her party formed a coalition with the center-right Motherland Party which
was followed by an alliance with the conservative far-right Welfare Party.
The later move resulted in heightened tension between True Path and the
military and business establishment.  In the current financial turmoil, Ms.
Ciller has attempted to reposition herself as a force that will regain the
nation's financial and political stability.

We shall forward to you shortly a copy of the message from Sandeep with the 
numbers you have 
requested.  What follows below are the extracts from two recent articles on 
the power situation in India
published by The Financial Times. 

The first article describes recent power outage in northern India affecting 
millions of people.
One possible line of defense is pointing out to the value of  output lost due 
to  power
shortages. It is obvious that the value of lost production exceeds the cost 
of power produced
by the Dhabol plant (expensive as it may be). The power cut affected 230 
million people.

The second article is Enron specific.

                     ASIA-PACIFIC: Power failure hits north India 
                     Financial Times; Jan 3, 2001
                     By ANGUS DONALD

                     Tens of millions of people were left without electricity 
in northern India
                     yesterday after a power grid breakdown. 

                     Electricity was gradually switched on in some areas and 
most parts of the
                     capital New Delhi, with 60 to 70 per cent of supply 
expected to be restored
                     by the end of the day, according to power grid 
officials. 

                     The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry 
(Assocham), a
                     leading business organisation, expressed ""deep concern"" 
and called for a
                     mechanism to prevent future disruption that could 
""cripple the economy"". 

                     The power failure across eight Indian states, including 
New Delhi, disrupted
                     train services, water supplies and the telephone network 
and forced
                     hospitals to switch to emergency generators. 

                     The fault occurred on the Northern Grid, which provides 
electricity for 226m
                     people, and affected the states of Delhi, Haryana, 
Punjab, Uttar Pradesh,
                     Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Jammu 
and Kashmir. 

                     A breakdown at a sub-station in Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh, 
India's most
                     populous state, caused an overload of power on other 
lines, which then
                     failed as well. 

                     Trains stopped running for most of the day and signals 
systems were
                     damaged. New Delhi international airport was also 
slightly affected before
                     its own power supply could be engaged. 

                     ""We will probe into the reasons for the failure. It is 
most likely to be a
                     technical failure, but we will investigate why it 
happened,"" Suresh Prabhu,
                     the power minister, was quoted as saying by Press Trust 
of India. 

                     India suffers regularly from power problems because of 
lack of funding to
                     upgrade infrastructure. Theft of supplies is also a big 
problem. Thirty per
                     cent of the country's electricity is stolen, according 
to analysts. In New
                     Delhi as much as 50 per cent is stolen. 

                     Two years ago, a power failure blacked out Uttar Pradesh 
and Delhi for
                     hours. 

                     Assocham issued a statement, saying that increasing 
industrial demand
                     would exacerbate the problems already faced by India's 
inefficient power
                     sector. ""The slow progress, particularly in 
strengthening the transmission
                     and distribution system, and ever increasing theft will 
contribute to
                     worsening the power supply situation further.""

                     ASIA-PACIFIC: Energy group launches image offensive: 
Enron has a
                     plan to reverse its reputation as a profiteering 
multinational
                     operating in India, writes Khozem Merchant 

                     Financial Times; Jan 3, 2001
                     By KHOZEM MERCHANT

                     Enron, the US energy producer and a constant target of 
criticism in India, is
                     hitting back with a campaign to reverse its image as a 
profiteering
                     multinational. 

                     Its ""myth and reality"" offensive in local newspapers 
follows the west Indian
                     state of Maharashtra's decision to review the tariff it 
pays the Texas-based
                     company, whose Dollars 2.2bn electricity generating 
plant at Dabhol is
                     India's biggest single foreign investment. 

                     Maharashtra's tariff has more than doubled since 1993 
and is three times
                     greater than that charged by other independent power 
producers (IPPs).
                     The tariff has risen because of the depreciation of the 
rupee against the
                     dollar and the high but now falling price of naphtha 
fuel. The state also pays
                     a fixed capacity charge of Rs970m (Dollars 21m) a month, 
reflecting the
                     huge project cost and, controversially, irrespective of 
consumption. 

                     A showdown looks inevitable, reminiscent of a clash six 
years ago that
                     damaged India's appeal to foreign investors. A former 
official of the World
                     Bank, which has criticised the deal, says Enron is 
emerging ""as the East
                     India Company of the 21st century"" - a reference to the 
British trader that
                     colonised key areas of the Indian economy in the 19th 
century. 

                     The stand-off is the latest blot on India's power 
sector. The UK's PowerGen
                     and Cogentrix of the US have quit India recently, 
frustrated by long approval
                     procedures, inadequate payments mechanisms or because of 
higher
                     returns elsewhere. 

                     ""India has lost time and opportunity and has driven 
returns down by six
                     percentage points,"" says Gerry Grove-White, former India 
general manager
                     of PowerGen, which has sold its 655MW plant in Gujarat 
to China Light &
                     Power of Hong Kong. 

                     India's national plan for the five years to 2002 says 
generating capacity
                     must rise by 40,000MW to about 120,000MW. But since 
1992, IPPs have
                     added only 3,000MW and 2,500MW remains under 
construction. This is
                     insufficient to support official projections of 6 to 8 
per cent economic
                     growth. 

                     Enron was a bellwether of India's liberalisation, 
winning fast-track project
                     approval in the early 1990s. Phase 1, a 740MW plant 
fuelled by expensive
                     naphtha came on stream in May 1999, and phase 2, a 
Dollars 1.87bn plant
                     of 1,624MW capacity that will run on cheaper liquefied 
natural gas (LNG),
                     will be completed this year. Only two of seven other 
fast-track proposals
                     have achieved financial closure. 

                     From the outset Enron encountered attacks, culminating 
in Maharashtra's
                     then nationalist government cancelling the project 
before renegotiating
                     terms no less onerous. Vilasrao Deshmukh, chief minister 
of the successor
                     government, says the power purchase agreement is 
unaffordable. 

                     Enron, whose attackers also include cultural 
chauvinists, wants to maintain
                     good political relations in a hostile but lucrative 
environment. Enron views
                     India as a testing ground for its evolution from a 
traditional manager of
                     power plants to a broad-based trader of commodities, 
such as energy, gas
                     and bandwidth. 

                     To support these ambitions Enron hopes to trade energy 
between power
                     surplus and deficit states, once legislation is passed 
this year. It is building
                     an LNG terminal and pipelines to trade imported natural 
gas. And it is
                     laying a 15,000km fibre-optic network to trade bandwidth 
space in a country
                     desperately short of this new economy commodity. 

                     In any event, Enron believes it has a watertight 
contract. It is supported by
                     many that believe any subversion of the contract would 
confirm investor
                     perception of Maharashtra, India's financial and 
industrial hub, as an
                     unreliable destination for investment. 

                     Mr Deshmukh - who has avoided the language of his 
predecessor, which
                     threatened to ""dump Dabhol into the Arabian Sea"" - is 
under pressure from
                     radical members of his wobbly coalition. But his options 
are limited.
                     Scrapping the project would be ruinous for an 
economically troubled state
                     that would have to compensate shareholders. 

                     Maharashtra State Electricity Board, the local utility 
and Enron's main
                     client, is obliged to dispatch or ""off-take"" 90 per cent 
of Dabhol's output. Yet
                     MSEB has never honoured these guarantees. Its off-take 
has averaged 60
                     per cent since the plant opened and, in effect, MSEB has 
been paying a lot
                     more while consuming a lot less power. 

                     One reason off-take is low is because the state's tough 
new regulator has
                     told MSEB to buy from cheaper sources. Enron says the 
tariff would be
                     Rs4.02/kWh if MSEB's off-take averaged 90 per cent. But 
with off-take a
                     third lower, the average tariff is Rs4.94 per unit, and 
often higher. In
                     October, the tariff was Rs6.91 per unit, when off-take 
was about 49 per
                     cent. Enron says tariffs should come down when phase 2, 
run on cheaper
                     LNG, starts. 

                     These cost pressures have forced MSEB to take up only 
half of a 30 per
                     cent equity option in phase 2. Enron has acquired the 
balance and
                     mandated bankers to find a buyer. 

                     Enron's difficulties have undermined the appeal of IPPs, 
which have failed to
                     deliver the flood of investments. Potential IPPs feared 
they would never be
                     paid by state generating boards that have become a 
byword for corrupt
                     management of power. 

                     Reform of state electricity boards, whose uneconomic 
pricing means
                     industrial users subsidise poor farmers, as well as 
transmission and
                     distribution (T&D) services to check huge theft and 
technical losses, is
                     overdue. ""Given the limited resources, money would be 
better spent on T&D
                     rather than on new plant,"" says Oliver Blackaby, 
managing director of N M
                     Rothschild in India, which is advising Karnataka on the 
privatisation of its
                     distribution network. 

                     For the moment, attention is fixed on Enron's ability to 
satisfy the
                     competing interests of investors and clients. As Sanjay 
Bhatnagar, chief
                     executive officer of Enron India, said in a recent trade

Thanks Sherri.  

Franz Alphonse did not interview with Enron.  He may be interested in a 
business venture related to his company??  I can pull his resume for you if 
you like.  Just let me know.

Jay, Jeff received a call yesterday from a 2nd year HBS student and 
co-founder of a B2B commerce company - Franz Edward Alphonse - who wanted to 
speak to Jeff (for the ever-popular ""5 minutes"") about his company.  Jeff has 
asked that you follow up with this gentleman.  His phone number is 
617.493.5597.

(Karen, I'm copying you in the event you have any information on Mr. Alphonse 
- i.e., did he interview w/Enron and if so, how did he do).

Thanks, Jay.  Please send Jeff a note with any update once you have spoken to 
Franz.

SRS

PS - I'm back from Italy and ready to have that drink whenever it works for 
you and Greg.  I understand he's out for a few weeks now while he moves his 
family to Houston...

I tried sending this to you on Monday but had gotten an email rejection 
message from your email server? With summer time here, I hope you get some 
vacation in and that all is well with you and your associates. Permit me to 
again update you from our end:

TREND

At Noble Systems, we continue to expand and with an increasing number of new 
customers whose organizations had previously used some other predictive 
dialer but have now switched to us. One such new installation has just 
reported a net 20% increase in performance by switching to ATOMS.

REVAMPED WEBSITE

Noblesys.com has been totally revamped and with several new items added! 
Also, it is now a lot easier to navigate.  Please check it out!

In addition, under 'News' we've posted the announcement of our email ACD 
Module e_ATOMS ERMS (Email Response Management System) and our collaborative 
browsing module  e_ATOMS ""chat"". Please let me know if you'd like additional 
product information.

You'll also see our new trademark and ""Contact To The Nth Degree"" advertising 
tag.

NEW FEATURE

Agent-specific messaging. When an answer machine is encountered, ATOMS can 
leave a standard message without the call ever going to agent. Now with some 
agent identifying code in the dialing record, these messages may now be 
'agent-specific': in the agents own voice: ""Sorry I missed you. This is Dan 
Donaldson of Noble Systems calling about a wonderful opportunity. Please call 
me at 888-434-2537.""

DYNAMIC CAMPAIGN BUILDER (DCB)

Dynamic Campaign Builder (DCB) has earned Best of Show at CT Expo in Los 
Angeles (Computer Telephony Magazine - April Issue - details ATOMS DCB).

Dynamic Campaign Builder (DCB) enables supervisors to create entirely new 
outbound, inbound and blended campaigns and with graphical looking agent 
screens including branched logical scripts using embedded variables - and all 
without needing a programmer!

Please advise if you'd like more information on DCB and/or our DCB User 
Manual, I'll be glad to get it to you.

PERFECTSCRIPT

PerfectScript (Patent pending) eliminates people immediately hanging up 
because they notice the 'predictive delay time' do not want to hear ""another 
telemarketer"". PerfectScript is now in demand because on all outbound calls 
it minimizes this 'predictive delay time' by always promptly responding to 
the answering 'hello' with a recording in the agents own voice e.g. ""Hello, 
this is Jeffrey of Enron Capital & Trade Corporation, may I speak with"". As 
the agent, you hear most of your pre-recorded voice segment and when it ends, 
you simply speak and ask for the person being called.

And very importantly, with PerfectScript, every call automatically starts 
very positive and upbeat!

Additionally, PerfectScript also allows agents to use at will other 
pre-recorded segments e.g. responses to questions, standard instructions, 
disclosures etc. throughout the day. The other party does not detect any 
voice segment as being pre-recorded because there are no clicks or beeps. 
Agents talk less but since they pre-record these segments also using very 
positive voice inflections, their presentations are also more effective and 
upbeat!

OTHER SIGNIFICANT FEATURES

Interactive Voice Response (IVR) type functionality - Very importantly, 
callers can now get retrieve their information and balances without ever 
going to a live agent. Callers can be prompted for touch tone entries which 
may be used for routing, additional menu selections and/or voice messages.

Advanced Skills-based Routing - In addition to intelligent call routing to 
designated agent groups based upon unlimited ANI/DNIS combinations, ATOMS 
also enables you to rate each agent's proficiency in each of an unlimited of 
categories that you define. ATOMS will connect each incoming call to the most 
proficient agent available for the categories previously identified within 
the customer record.

ATOMS has now been internationalized. Among other benefits, support for all 
time zones and international telephone numbers is now included.

Near toll quality 16:1 end-to-end voice compression for remote locations.

Complete fault tolerance (via clustering).

EXTENDED SUPPORT HOURS

Responding to our growing install base, we now actually staff our customer 
support center 24 hours a day Monday thru Friday and 22 hours on Saturday. 
Support access via pagers is now only from Saturday night at 10:00 PM to 
12:01 AM on Monday morning.

EXPANDED PRODUCT FLEXIBILITY

ATOMS is now also available in lower-priced inbound-only configurations 
and/or inbound-only upgrades.

Also, with many ATOMS features, customers need only purchase the number of 
concurrent seats actually required. For example, predictive licenses, Digital 
Recording (DRS) ports, PerfectScript DRS ports, Email ACD (ERMS) licenses 
etc. may be shared by many different agents at different times as long as the 
total number of agents using any feature at any time does not exceed the 
total number of licenses purchased.

Jeffrey, I do hope you have a great summer and that this update is helpful. 
Whenever I can be of help in any way, please do not hesitate to call.

Have a great week!

down?  As an FYI, we saw huge fund liquidation today prompted by a poorly 
traded technical market--however it appears we have now achieved the downside 
targets the funds, etc. watch.  We also heard a rumor (started on the NYMEX 
floor) that the EIA changed their storage stats by 250 Bcf--showing a higher 
inventory.  In fact, the only thing we could find was an obscure update that 
showed a 
change of 25 Bcf only.  
When I asked all of the desk heads about their views of the market, the feel 
is still bullish.  We did see a couple of fertilizer plants stop buying gas 
(one actually sold).  Our traders don't see the tide turning yet with this 
info, however.  
Crude was extremely strong, the weather is hot, and some storage operators 
were also withdrawing.  (you know--mortgage the future sort of trading).  
Needless to say I'll not be knocking on the VAR door today.   Welcome to 
hurricane season 2000. 

On another note, we traded our first weekday only term gas in Texas this 
week, and we anticipate 5x16 gas markets(to serve the texas generators to 
start) trading by month end.

These meetings that were set up with Pawar in Delhi were supposed to be 
attended by Wade but but he was unable to attend them due to the fact that he 
fell sick. No agreements have been reached because there are none that are 
contemplated. All we have done is to encourage the GOM to approach the GOI 
for reducing their own liabilities. The details you will find in the other 
memo I have already sent to you. (I picked up your email after I finished 
sending my emails).  The approach as u will notice is no different than what 
we have been following all along and I believe that  you know that already.  
If u want further clarification, I am happy to discuss this with you or if u 
want to follow a different strategy then please let me know. I am at the 
Delhi Oberoi at  91-11-4363030, room 716.

Ken had expressed to me last week that you desired to take charge immediately 
and start moving the resolution of the Dabhol issues forward. I agree that 
this will be the best way forward. Given the way things are moving, I think 
that it would be best  that you arrive in Delhi immediately over the weekend 
so that I can introduce you to the players on Monday and start transitioning 
the relationships to you and Wade. Wade will join the team in delhi as soon

that require my presence there.

As you can appreciate, your presence in these meetings will be essential for 
you to start getting a feel for the situation on the ground and developing 
the rapport with the key players. The GOM is clearly driving the train and if 
we are to assist them its essential that we not slow them down and assist 
them in any way we can.

Subject: Meetings with Sharad Pawar

Sanjay,

Through several forwardings of memos it has come to my attention that you had 
several meetings this week with Sharad Pawar and reached some agreements.  I 
understand that a conference call to generate a strategy regarding our 
approach to Mr Pawar was cancelled and no one is able to explain to me what 
approach  you took or what the nature is of any agreements or accomodations 
that you may have struck in these meetings.  I think it is important that I 
and the rest of the task force be involved in the setting of strategy even if 
we will call on you to conduct any of the discussions and it is clear that it 
is cooperation and coordination is paramount.

Please call or write immediately with a briefing of those meetings and of any 
agreements that were agreed to.  In the future, I would appreciate better 
coordination and discussions on all matter related to Dabhol and to Metgas.  
I am available by phone day or night.

Regards
Rebecca

Following on from our brief discussion during your last visit to London, I 
just wanted to give you a heads-up on where we are with the Du Pont/ETOL 
steam/power deal given the discussions you and Harold had with them earlier 
in the year.  Based on prior experience in getting to closure with Du Pont, 
there is a chance that someone senior from Du Pont will put in a call to you 
or maybe Lou/Tom to express disappointment on progress and encourage Enron 
concessions, resulting in premature deal closure for us.

ETOL has tabled a blend-and-extend deal to Du Pont, in which they have shown 
interest to get to closure.  However, they just want to transact on the major 
value items for themselves now and then deal with other Enron value items 
next year in good faith.  We have indicated that we will commit Enron 
resource to get the whole deal done as soon as possible, specifying a Jan 01 
start, and will not allow cherry picking.

Whilst the overall impact to ETOL is PV neutral, the deal does substantially 
reduce long term volume risk on what is already a deep in the money deal for 
us.  The motivation for DuPont is that the deal results in immediate annual 
savings, around $3m in 2001, which fits with their corporate goal to deliver 
energy savings.

If you are called by Du Pont and need more info let me know.  We want the 
whole package from them.

Through YPO International, we got a membership inquiry from Rick Barsky,
CEO of Agennix(don't know what company does).  He apparently used to work
at Enron.  Bio says he was involved in start up of Enron Renewable Energy

You don't know how nice it is receiving your e-mails, and to hear how
excited you are.  There's no Hemingway in the making here, but I see you
know that he got his start as a journalist.  Did you also know his first
serious work was covering the the two Balkan wars (1912-14) in the city of
Erdine (the Greek, and more famous, name is Adrianople), which is just west
of here on what is now the border of Turkey and Greece.  (I visited Erdine
several months ago; its another messy, beautiful Turkish town.)   Some
historians consider these wars to really be part of World War I.  And I
guess he witnessed part of the huge cross-migrations of Turks and Greeks,
when at the foundation of the Turkish Republic (1923) hundreds of thousands
of Greeks left Turkey and hundreds of thousands of Turks left Greece.  (Both
counties were previously part of the more tolerant Ottoman Empire, the
existence of which was destroyed by the rise of nationalism in the last two
centuries.)  This migration, a tragedy of epic proportions (know now simply
as the ""Mubadele [The Exchange]"" in Turkish) was probably one of the first
examples of large scale ethnic cleansing.

About having gone through a lot, not true.  Today is beautiful day here in
Istanbul, pleasantly cool (after an awfully hot and humid summer), the air
cleared by a nightime rain.  It was tough to imagine the pain and hardship
going on just several miles west and east of here, to which now is added mud
and cold.  This morning I taught my students (at the Istanbul branch office
of a German company that makes silicon and silicon products) the English
expression ""Every dark cloud has a silver lining""  I feel I've lived my
life, when not under perfectly clear skies, in the silver linings.

More later.  I too am excited to see what happens between now and tomorrow's
deadline.  Will keep you secretly (i.e. bcc) posted.

Hope you got a good night's sleep.

Mark

The afternoon ezan is as if a lament.  The muezzin's voice seems fuller,
more emotional, and he sings strong and slow.  (Because the electricity in
my neighborhood had been off most of the day, apparently as a precaution
against fire, it was the first amplified call to prayer I have heard today.)
  But it is not for us he wails.  My neighborhood has been relatively
untouched; some fallen masonry, an empty top floor apartment overlooking the
square surrounding the Galata Tower half collapsed, debris from it partially
blocking the road that circles the square.

Thousands are suspected dead in an incredible series of earthquakes, the
first a possible and unfathomable 7.8 on the Richter scale, that began this
morning at 3:02.  Images on the TV are horrific: a five story building off
its foundation leaning against the building next to it; a warehouse, its
roof collapsed, on fire; the top half of a minaret toppled; a bridge severed
neatly into four parts, collapsed.  Worse yet, dozens of apartment buildings
flattened into cruel piles of concrete beams and slabs, twisted steel
reinforcement and rubble.  A handsome father breaks down in the arms of
friends in front of one such monstrosity.  At another, a reporter shoves her
microphone into a hole under a concrete beam, interviews someone trapped
there, the camera then panning back to show an impossible heap of debris
above.

I had trouble getting to sleep last night, which was unusual.  Ismail and I
had spent a fine evening at one of our favorite outdoor caf?s, under trees
whose leaves were gently tussled by a breeze coming down the Bosphorus.
(Nearby was the impressive bulk of the Nusretiye Mosque, built by Sultan
Mahmut the Second some 150 years ago to celebrate his victory over the
corrupt Janissary  [a kind of special guard to the Sultan].)  We spoke of
writing, of nationalism, about my upcoming trip to the States, about
learning a new language, about a possible trip together in the winter along
the coast of the Aegean Sea.  We were both particularly buoyant, with the
worst of the summer heat and humidity seemingly behind us.  In retrospect,
it was as if we were summing some things up, a minor period in our lives
over, a new one soon to begin.  I returned home around midnight, lay in my
bed mulling (absurdly) over possible problems that might arise on trips that
are many weeks away.  The last time I looked at my watch it was well after 2
am.

It seemed that something woke me up other than the shaking, though I'm not
sure.  It may have been dogs barking, a person yelling, or the birds.
Perhaps it was simply the first gentle movements of the quake, triggering
deeply imbedded memories and fears from the 1989 quake I experienced in San
Francisco.  I was up out of my bed, though still half a sleep, before it got
really bad.  There was a crazy mess of sounds from wood and metal, and
whatever, squeaking and creaking around me.  The movement and sounds
confused me at first, and I remember thinking for a moment or two that there
were other people in my place, and that this was the problem.  Soon,
however, there was no question what was happening.  By then I was in my
hallway, where three doorways were close together.

The first moments of a serious earthquake, when you are up in a building,
are as if the earth below is swelling, the building riding those swells like
waves.  Then it gets awful, out of control, and it is nothing at all like
the comfort of riding waves.  I felt the sickening feeling of my building
being all too easily whipped around from side to side, and otherwise.
Though it was dark, the ceilings, walls and floors all seemed at absurd new
angles vis-a-vis each other.  The shaking was bad enough I could imagine
that things might start collapsing.  From time to time I darted out of the
relatively safety of the hallway, to grab my sweats, a jacket, my bag.  Soon
the shaking stopped -- I heard it lasted some 45 seconds -- and then I
really started racing to get outside.  I must have been soaked with
adrenaline by this point, remembering to grab my Turkish dictionary, a
flashlight (which unfortunately wasn't assembled -- I did that later -- and
I had to root around the drawer for the batteries), some extra cash, even my
camera.  The electricity stayed on for a bit, which was helpful, but was off
by the time I opened my door a minute or two later.

My place is five stories up, on the top floor, and there's a veranda off to
one side.  Perhaps unwisely, though I couldn't resist, I went out on it for
a quick look out over the city.  It was dark except for a moving light here
and there, the headlights of cars.  Something may have been burning across
the Golden Horn, in the Balat neighborhood.  I could see the silhouettes of
a few of the great Mosques against a sky now full of beautiful stars.
Below, a car alarm had gone off, and people were yelling and shouting.  I
worked my way carefully down the stairs, concerned that they may have
collapsed.

I spent most of the next two or three hours with the crowd that had gathered
in the relative safety of the square around the Galata Tower (though I
occasionally shot a worried look up at that huge mass looming above us).  At
one point I took a long walk, further up my hill, then along Istiklal
Caddesi, my part of the city's main street.  Other than the electricity
being out, and the people on the streets, there was little physical evidence
of the earthquake.  Some masonry had fallen.  As I mentioned above, an
abandoned apartment was half collapsed near my place.  I saw no one hurt.
But I did saw people in their underwear, a women mumbling about Mohammed, in
one hand a water bottle, the other with its palm turned up to the sky (which
as I said was starry).  Some people were laughing, others were crying, most
were huddled together in small groups talking quietly.  Many of the women
were wearing headscarves, more than usual it seemed.  An outdoor caf? next
to the tower opened and served tea and water.  I knew a few people there
and, with my poor Turkish, learned that in was really bad in Izmit, sixty of
so miles east of here, that even here in Istanbul a few buildings may have
collapsed.  Dawn came and I returned to my apartment, slept for a few hours.
  That sleep was interrupted and made fitful by what I learned later were a
series of fairly significant aftershocks.

On the television, a crowd just burst into applause.  A young boy has been
rescued from one collapsed building.  Except for being dusty, he appears
unscathed.  As they carry him to an ambulance a reporter follows, asking him
questions.  Were you scared?  ""Cok kokum [very scared]!""  He seems pleased
to be back in the world, by the attention he's getting.  Then he is asked
about his family.  His eyes grow wide, his face long.  ""Annem [my mother],
kardesim [my sister/brother], sesleri duydum [I heard their voices].
Duydum!""  By the time they reach the ambulance, he is screaming.  ""Sesleri
duydum!  Sesleri duydum!""

Turkiye, iyi sanslar.

Significant progress has been made in our quest to locate an alternate  venue 
for our Thursday night rendezvous.
?
The suggestion actually came from Queensbury, NY of all places.? Yes,  
brother Rob Rossell ('77) has volunteered his brother Bill's  
establishment....Lakewood Landing.? Tom Benson says it's near Stan's Blue  
Note Inn.
?
A brief description, details and directions will follow.
?
I spoke to Mike Arends today...it looks like Mike will be joining us in  
spite of the fact that he will be at the alter 2 weeks later.? Rob Rossell  
tells me that Tim Strange is coming down with Harry Singleton.? The  brothers 
just keep on coming out of the woodwork.? Rob Bugh got into the  loop only 
recently- too late to make plans to leave the flock behind.
?
Though he's become a silver-gray, his hand keeps time and measure...check  
out Elvis doin' the hambone thing (attachment).? A Beta Top 40 included  too!

It would be a HUGE help if a car could meet me at the Four Seasons (1300

Where should we meet with Jeff tomorrow at 8:15??

Kevin, I got your message about not being available for dinner -  no
problem.  The other panelists were arriving too late also, so the dinner
was cancelled.

I just wanted to touch base and make sure you had everything thing you need
for tomorrow morning.  I'm attaching a map to the North Shepherd facility;
it's about 10 minutes outside of downtown.  I would be happy to make
arrangements for a sedan to pick you up if you like; just let me know from
where.

The event begins with a buffet breakfast at 7:30 a.m. and your panel will
begin at 8:45 a.m.  Jeff would like to meet with you, David Arnoff  and
John Thornton around 8:15 a.m. to cover any last minute items about the
panel.
I'll be at the North Shepherd facility beginning about 2:00 p.m. CDT today,
so you can reach me on my cell phone (713.854.1426).  Do not hesitate to
call me should you have any questions or need additional information as I
will not have access to e-mail after 2:00 p.m.

Dear Jeff,

Hope you are doing well.  It has been quite a long time since we last spoke
when I was with Pathnet.  I have since started another company called Cogent
Communications and the company has been progressing very well in the last
year.

I'm in the process of putting together an Advisory Committee for the company
composed of industry, business, and political leaders.  I think your depth
of experience in telecom could add a lot of value to the company and am
looking to gauge your interest level in joining the committee.  The
commitment is limited to one meeting per year and you would receive stock in
the company.  Thus far we have commitments from Sergio Zyman of Coca Cola
and are in discussions with Bob Dole and Vernon Jordan.

Cogent is a facilities-based ISP offering very high bandwidth Internet
access to business users in the top tier cities in the US.  Utilizing the
latest in fiber-optic technology, we've built an all optical nationwide
network and are offering 100mbps non-oversubscribed service for a flat rate
of $1,000 per month.  Feel free to take a look at our website at
www.cogentco.com.  The company has raised over $350MM in financing to date
with investors including Oak Investment Partners, Broadview Capital, Texas
Pacific Group, Capital Research, and Worldview Technology Partners.

Please give me a call/email at your earliest convenience.  I look forward to
speaking with you and catching up.

Sincerely,

Dave Schaeffer, CEO

Subject: Employee Communications with OOC

Ken/Jeff/Joe:

 As you may know, I have recently been hired to direct the new Office of 
Labor and Employment Relations (formerly Fair Employment and Labor 
Practices).  One of the many major roles of my group is to conduct 
investigations into employee allegations of discrimination, harassment, and 
other unfair treatment. One recent investigation involved an employee who was 
communicating via e-mail with your office on a constant and unyielding 
basis.  As experience shows, this is not an uncommon occurrence as some 
employees feel that they must go to the top to get attention.

 As you have been doing, please direct all such employee communications to me 
for prompt processing.  This will enable you to avoid being subjected to 
depositions and trial testimony in any subsequent legal proceeding as a fact 
witness.  Naturally, I will keep you informed as to the results of the 
investigation to any extent that you desire.

 Please let me know if you have any questions, comments, or concerns.

Adrian Lajous is leaving Pemex,
and will be substituted by Rogelio Montemayor.
I have known Rogelio for some time; he is an outsider to the Energy sector, 
but a good Economist, who has 
held both technical positions in past Governments, as well as elected officer 
( Congressman, Senator and Governor
of Coahuila).
Rogelio is close to Francisco Labastida, the PRI candidate to the Presidency 
(elections-July 2000), and was proposed
by Luis Tellez (Secretary of Energy) as a transition CEO of Pemex, with whom 
he can work in some deregulation initiatives
before the change of Government (Dec. 2000).
This leaves our friend Luis Tellez in a very powerful position, since he was 
able to remove both the head of CFE & Pemex,
who were opposing his deregulation efforts. Hopefully, he will be able to 
transcend the change of Administration, and keep
his drive and level of influence.

Saturday - March 31 - Columbus - 8:00 AM - 56 miles - (hilly)
Here is the Conoco series, sponsored by Steve Moskowitz - This is ride #12, 
and there are 14 in the series, at a cost of $20 total.  Questions:  Patrick 
Scales at Enron - 713-345-3673.

You read the note right - it says we're starting from COLUMBUS, Tx!

Sorry this note is a day late and still missing a key detail - the exact
starting location - but due to the Round Top/Warrenton Antique Fair (100,000
visitors/day), we felt we needed to modify our route this Saturday.  There
is a hilly 56 mile route which starts in Columbus and covers many of the
same challenging hills as the ride originally planned but stays away from
Round Top, Warrenton, and Fayetteville and the busy roads immediately around
these towns.

Weekly Ride - Columbus, TX, Sat, 3/31 - 8 am

This week, we'll still get our hill training in and will have the
opportunity to climb the same hill (Lone Oak) that we would have had to
climb on the New Ulm route.  This ride is a 56 mile loop starting in
Columbus, hitting Lone Oak and Frelsburg and picking up beautiful
Zimmerscheidt Road going the other direction.  The Rides Around Houston book
gives this ride a score of ""9"" for exercise potential so look for some
hills.

The ride will start at 8:00 am sharp.  Columbus is an hour from the Sam
Houston Tolway/I-10 intersection so please allow yourself time to arrive in
Columbus by 7:15 am.

Directions to the Start - Beason's Park
We have permission to use Beason's Park as the starting off point.  Someone
is using the pavilion from 2:00pm to 7:00pm, and I told Judy that most of us
would be gone by then and we didn't really need the pavilion.  Beason's Park
does have restrooms, however, I will not vouch for the condition.

Beason's park is on US 90 just east of Columbus.  The most direct way is to
take I-10 to exit 698 (US 90 exit) and take US 90 west.  The park is on the
left hand side of the road just before the bridge over the Colorado river.
For those of you (like us) coming from Magnolia/The Woodlands the best way
is to take FM 949 to I-10.  We stay on the feeder which becomes US 90 at
exit 698.

If you want to pick up food or go to the bathroom before the ride, stay on
I-10 until exit 696 (Hwy 71).  There are convenience stores and bathrooms at
this exit.  At this point you can either take Hwy 71 north to US 90 and turn
right (east) to get to the park (which will be on your right just after the
bridge) or get back on I-10 to exit 698.

NOTE - As we get out into the country, I highly recommend stopping at the
local stores for your sport drinks, water, and a quick rest stop.  Your
drinks will be colder this way, you will have a timely rest stop, and the
local business will look forward to our return.

Here's a few reminders for those of you who are new to the list or have a
short memory:

Starting Time - 8:00 am - SHARP!
There were a lot of riders pulling into Cat Springs at 7:55 last Saturday.
If you arrive in Columbus after 7:30 and aren't fast at bike prep and
signing in, you'll get left at the start this week.  PLEASE allow time to
get to Columbus between 7:15 and 7:30.  Even though we're not riding to
Warrenton, we want to be off the roads as early as possible.

Check-in Process
Every rider is expected to sign in to indicate that they have started the
ride and sign-out on their return.  We have no way of knowing that you are
on the road and may need assistance if you don't sign in.  PLEASE arrive
early enough to sign in and remember to sign out when you finish the ride.

If you have completed the online or paper waiver, your name will appear on
the alphabetical sign-in sheets.  They are split up into groups of 5-6
sheets to speed up the sign in process so look for the clip board with your
name.  If this is your first ride and you haven't signed up online, you need
to complete a paper waiver and fill in your name on the blank sign-in sheet.
If you completed a paper waiver last Saturday and your name is not listed on
the alpha list, it's because you didn't sign the waiver (3 of you), you
signed one but didn't provide any emergency information, or I just couldn't
read your handwriting (5 VERY sloppy waivers last week!).  PLEASE arrive
early enough to fill out a legible waiver or slow down a minute when filling
it out.

I hate to harp on these details but it is vital that everyone help out to
ensure that you have a safe and fun ride.

Thanks!

attached changes to the Analyst / Associate PRC process, prior to execution.  
In summary, the following modifications have been developed by the heads of 
the AAPRC Committees (Horton, Kean, and Sherriff) and A/A Program Management 
(Lemmons):

? Most cross-calibration will be at the business unit level, since this is 
where the best interaction and information gathering occurs.  Steps to ensure 
consistency across the business units are outlined in the memo.  The final 
PRC meeting will focus on business unit ranking distributions, and the 
names/attributes of the top performers across the company.
? The PRC committees have been expanded to improve the quality of 
representation, and to reflect the diversity of our workforce.  The additions 
were selected from a pool of high performing VPs and Directors.  To ensure 
fairness, only VPs and Directors will provide representation on the AAPRC 
Committee.  
? An attachment has been included to clarify program tenure and promotion 
criteria.

Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss by 
mid-day Wednesday, May 9.  We are planning to release this information to the 
memo distribution list that evening.

Beta Thursday Night Gang,

Significant progress has been made in our quest to locate an alternate
venue for our Thursday night rendezvous.

The suggestion actually came from Queensbury, NY of all places.  Yes,
brother Rob Rossell ('77) has volunteered his brother Bill's
establishment....Lakewood Landing.  Tom Benson says it's near Stan's Blue
Note Inn.

A brief description, details and directions will follow.

I spoke to Mike Arends today...it looks like Mike will be joining us in
spite of the fact that he will be at the alter 2 weeks later.  Rob
Rossell tells me that Tim Strange is coming down with Harry Singleton.
The brothers just keep on coming out of the woodwork.  Rob Bugh got into
the loop only recently- too late to make plans to leave the flock behind.

Though he's become a silver-gray, his hand keeps time and measure...check
out Elvis doin' the hambone thing (attachment).  A Beta Top 40 included
too! (don't worry Jansson, I still have my day job)

Fall is coming brothers...it was 40 degrees when I left for work the
other morning.  It was the first day since early June that I had to wear
long pants to work.  We had a high of 60 degrees.  I guess I better get
used to it.  This winter I will be working outdoors every day...a good
number of below zero days can be counted on.  However, I predict terrific
weather in Dallas the entire homecoming weekend.

Bino is finally a solid yes and Harry Singleton told me that he was
planning to be there too.  Still no word from those mid west boys, except
Dave Lesh and Tom Hutchison.

Woody has volunteered to be in charge of getting our tickets for the
SMU-Nevada homecoming game.  Fire off an e-mail and let him know how many
tickets you will be needing:  boethia@hotmail.com

If you are interested in playing some golf with John Grumbles at his

Subject: Harvard Update

Leonel Azuela (Harvard) verbally DECLINED our offer to become an Associate at 
Enron.  He will accept a position with McKinzie in Houston.  He said he 
really appreciated the calls and the follow up especially from Jeff Skilling 
and he wants to keep in touch since he will be in Houston.  Leonel said that 
due to his financial situation, he really had no choice but to accept the 
McKinzie offer at this time.  Other than that, he admires and respects Enron 
and thought we did a top notch job with our follow up. He really envied the 
opportunities we had to offer.  It was truly a monetary issue.

BUT... It's not over, we still have 4 outstanding offers for HBS that expire 
on February 15th.  Please call the candidates and offer your assistance in 
answering any questions about the organization or Houston in general that may 
help them with their decision.  

The candidates are:      
     David Frost   617-562-1872
     Scott Landry   617-661-8499
     Amy VanBuskirk 617-868-1816
     Antonio Vivanco  617-868-9008 

I spoke to everyone last week and I know that a few want more time.  For 
example, some candidates are doing very targeted searches that are outside of 
the campus recruiting process.  Unfortunately, we cannot extend our 
deadline.  I honestly think we have a chance with these candidates.  It is 
important to emphasize the opportunities at Enron because most of them have 
other offers that exceed our package, but if they look at the BIGGER PACKAGE, 
we are very much a contender.  It's our job to sell them on that long term 
opportunity and to look beyond the short term.

Thanks for your help.

Karen Marshall
Recruiting Manager

Jeff, next October 23, 24, 25 in Laguna Niguel, Texas Pacific is hosting
their annual  portfolio company CEO conference (about 50 CEO;s in
attendance).  TPG ( a client of mine), you may know, is a premier private
equity investor--known best perhaps for Continental Airlines or if you ride
motorcycles Ducati,. $10billion in funds investment and good guys, you may
have met Jim Coulter, or David Bonderman or Bill Price, the senior
partners. They love to have you as their keynote speaker and I think it
would be worth your while.  Let me know if it works or whether I can
connect you up with them directly. I hope all is going well and
congratulations on your formal recognition as CEO.. Cheers Bill  P.S. Steve
Ballmer mentioned to me a couple of weeks ago that his meeting with you
last year was ""one of the most influential he's had""

CEO Conference





Bill --

As we discussed by voicemail, it would be great if you could connect with
Jeff Skilling to see if he would be interested in speaking at the TPG CEO
conference on the topic of Growth. Kristina sent over to Dick a copy of our
growth pamphlet, which he may also wish to use at the conference.  Enron is
featured prominently in the pamphlet as a great example of a growth story.

By way of background for Jeff, TPG has combined funds of well over $10
billion under management including its most recent $4.5 billion fund.
Their investments are loosely split between telecom, high tech, Europe and
all other.  They also have partial interests in a number of specialty funds
including Newbridge (Asia and Latin American), Aqua (water-related
investments), Colony (real estate), Gryphon (early stage, growth) and a
number of others including newly created venture and crossover funds.
There will be over 50 CEOs at their conference, including Continental
Airlines, America West, Del Monte, Beringer, Ducati, Bally, and a host of
others.

I can't remember the exact date for the conference, but I think Dick
mentioned the fall time frame.

Please let me/Dick know if Jeff would be interested in speaking with Dick
further.

Subject: CEO - congrats


Rocky,
I saw the announcement of your promotion in the Austin paper a couple days ago
and wanted to send my congratulations.   I recall our freshman year, you wrote
your chemistry paper on energy, I wrote mine on semiconductors.  Little did we
know our initial interests as 18 year olds would become our careers.

Arends says he sees you regularly when you hold your financial reviews.  I
wasn't able to make it to his wedding.  Did you? If so, how was it?

Sorry we weren't able to connect at the reunion in October, I really hoped 
we'd
have a chance to catch up on what's happened since we last talked (maybe 15
years ago?).    Hope you aren't overwhelmed with the Beta egroups email 
banter.
It's been fun reacquainting with the brothers.  I'm getting together with Bill
Jordan next month in California on one of my trips.  I know you're busy, but 
if
you have a second, drop a reply.

I'm proud of your career accomplishments and our shared history and 
friendship.
Good work, worm.
Have a great holiday.
-kai-

These names are probably all GREEK to Geoff Anderson and his mates...but

Sherri,

When I got your message, I was certain I had thrown the ticket away.  But, I
was happy to find that I had procrastinated and still had it.  It will be in
the mail shortly.

The trip did go well; thanks for setting it up.

I'm curious to know whether Jeff kept the ponytail and tattoo?

was tremendous and, in some cases, very creative.  Your fellow employees 
asked for everyone from Britney Spears to George Bush.  In all, we received 
requests for 61persons outside of Enron to host an eSpeak event.  We thought 
you might like to know who your colleagues find interesting, so we've 
provided a sampling of the suggestions below.  Here are the top ten most 
requested eSpeakers.

10.  Jack Welch, CEO, General Motors 
9.  Scott McNeally, CEO, Sun Microsystems 
8.  Satisfied Enron Customers
7.  Stephen Covey, author, The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People
6.  Oprah Winfrey, talkshow host
5.  General Colin Powell, former Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, U.S.A. 
4.  Alan Greenspan, Chairman, Federal Reserve, U.S.A.
3.  Former U.S. President George Bush 
2.  Bill Gates, CEO, Microsoft 
1.  Texas Governor George W. Bush

While we can't make any promises, we will do our best to bring in at least 
some of these special guests.  If you have any contacts who could help us get 
in touch with these guest speakers, please let us know at ethink@enron.com.  
Everybody needs a little help now and then, even eSpeak.

There were plenty of internal speakers requested, as well.  Those requests 
should be somewhat easier to meet, although scheduling time with some of our 
colleagues can be quite a task!

I've also asked Price Waterhouse to update all the accounts of Swanswalk Ltd

First, thank you so much for your hospitality the other evening. And
good company.

I emailed Jane and she will get the message Monday morning. I put you on
the message as well so now you have her address.  When I see her I will
fill her in on details and mention your willingness to be an active
parent when Kristen comes here.

I will also email Brenda Bouchard at the Harvard Club. If you are still
interested.


So I checked out enron. You didn't say you were the *largest* energy
trading company!  Or even say it was a large energy company.   Just gas
or oil too?  Does the name Charles Lawrence mean anything to you?  Wall
Street. Oil specialty. Checking out your history skills.

Let me know if there is anything more I can do at BU,  and let us know
when you are coming to Boston again.  Maria and Cheryl are very wired
into the Hill scene. Maria at the Union Club and Governor's office and
Chery everywhere in Boston. And Jane (who you will meet) in the Bahamas.

I am forwarding an analysis put together by Sandeep Kohli and reviewed by 
Vince and me.  The results in the attached word document show that Dabhol 
energy costs are several cents below that of roughly 600 MW of distributed 
generation which has been identified in Maharastra.  This 600 MW does not 
include innumerable small generators which will have even worse energy 
costs.  The excel spreadsheet contains the data and calculations.

Vince/Stinson,

Please find the two attachments that give a more detailed calculation, as 
well as the revised statement that can be made to press.

The numbers are not small, but really do not reflect the true magnitude of 
the genset issue.  They do not take into account the capital costs of the 
gensets, and also do not focus on the many smaller units that are operating 
in homes, and commercial establishments.

Hope ths helps.

Subject: Genesis Park


Jeff, I've been meaning to corner you at one of the YPO functions to spend a
minute discussing a couple of topics.  First and foremost, I wanted to
introduce Genesis Park which is a ""new economy"" investment company that's
been recently founded here in Houston by Paul Hobby, Fred Lummis, Steve
Gibson, Peter Shaper, Bruce Herzog and myself.  Paul and I were hoping to
have an opportunity to spend 30 minutes with you in the next few weeks to
describe in person what we're all about.  And to be clear, we're not looking
for Enron money, we are raising money from private individuals.  We've
already met with Jay Fitzgerald and Steve Horn to establish the
Enron/Genesis business relationship.

I also wanted to get your views on Enron's approach to oil trading and
whether the Vitol Group presented an opportunity.  Frankly, I think Vitol is
an excellent acquisition target although the success they've enjoyed in the
last year or two will make it a bit more difficult.  They have an
unbelievable franchise, but they also have some fundamental weaknesses which
could be exploited to Enron's benefit.  I'm shooting in the dark here but
hopefully it's worth some discussion.

If you can free some time during this busy holiday period to meet, it would
be greatly appreciated.  Paul and I could come to your office, or possibly
you could come to our ""offices"" over on Hermann Park.  We're buying 17 acres
on Hermann Park adjacent to the Park Lane Towers which we plan to develop
into a technology park.  For the time being, we are officing in a high tech
shed on the property!

Please let me know.  Thanks/Neil.

Thakns again for your concern.  You're asking a lot of good questions.

The best indication my building is ok is that its standing, and that it's
contemporaires are all standing as well.  You may have read that the
buildings that fell for the most part are of new vintage and are in the
lowlands.  Mine is neither.  Spoke to my landlord today, who is an engineer
of some sort, and for what its worth he said the building is a good one.

About shots, I got all ones recommended by my doctor before I left SF,
though he wasn't planning for one of the worst natural disasters in our
time.  I'm keeping my eye out about the how and why of the spread of the
diseases they're worried about here, but am pretty sure that one cirterion
is that you have to be pretty darn close, which I'm not.

I'm not our sticking my nose into anything, though would love to see things
up close for curiosity's sake.  Trouble is, I'd just be getting in the way,
which I don't want to do.  So will, for now, restrict myself to giving a
little cash and observing what goes on here on the home front.  The damage
really is not apparent from here.  As I mentioned in my note to dad, things
are pretty darn normal.  Expect indirect impact to be visable, like
worsening inflation for example.  But that's about it.  Will keep an eye out
for trouble, though.

More later.  Thanks again for taking the time to write.  Its always nice to
hear from you.

Love,

Mark

Hi Jeff.

I am Mike's brother, Ronnie, living in San Diego and a member of the San
Diego Chapter of YPO.  With all the propaganda being spread about the
electricity and energy crisis we are experiencing here in California, I
thought it would be worthwhile to invite you to town to give us an
insider's view on what is really going on (aka, the ""truth"").  Is there
anyway you can find time in your busy schedule to visit us over dinner
with a short talk and a question and answer period.  The sooner the
better.

I will schedule a ""special"" meeting of our chapter to accommodate any
dates that work for you.

I look forward to hearing from you.

our meeting May 8th to form a new Forum (Forum VIII).
This decision was based on the current Forum
membership (81); the number of new members wishing to
participate; and the number of prospective members
currently in process.

The new Forum affords a unique opportunity for
existing members.  In an effort to blend the
experience of new members with seasoned Forum members,
we are looking for the following:
     a) A member who wishes to change Forums
     b) Current Forum member having 3 years or less
     eligibility remaining in YPO who would like to
     help mentor an additional Forum.

We are considering that this may give a member the
opportunity to interact with other Houston YPOers or
perhaps re-invigorate an individual's Forum
experience.

If you have any interest, please contact me by May
22nd.  Please know that all questions, thoughts, or
expressions of interest will be held by me in strict
confidence.

By way of process, the new Forum will participate in
the draw with the other Forums who have indicated they
need members.  They will select first in the order.

We trust that this process will give the new Forum an
immediate opportunity to be successful.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Subject: Harvard Forum 05/18/01 - Second Invite


There are only a few available spaces at the upcoming Harvard Forum.  Don't
miss this new and exciting event.  Make your reservations today.  See
meeting details below.
**********************************************

Harvard University Club of Houston - Harvard Forum
=01&Raising Children of Character in A World of Affluence=018
Dinner and Discussion Club

Join us for a new type of Harvard Club experience.  Ever wanted to talk
substantively about a topic, while having a great dinner, but were afraid
that your dinner guests would not be able to go the distance with you in
the conversation?  We have the solution.

Modeled after a format that members David and Anne Grizzle and Danguole
Spakevicius and William Altman have been enjoying for years, the Harvard
Forum will provide an opportunity for an extended conversation with fellow
club members.

The format works like this:  we=01,ll have dinner, and then a panel of Harv=
ard
grads will give brief introductions to the evening=01,s topic from their
perspective, and then we will all engage the topic for ourselves, first in
a large group and then in small groups.  The panel members will be
knowledgeable, but not so expert that anyone will be intimidated.  They
will, however, be provocative to assure that the subsequent conversation is
lively.  You will come away knowing your fellow club members better than
ever - maybe better than you ever wanted.

The topic we=01,ve picked is one with which many of us have struggled.  Our
children may be growing up in a world far more affluent - privileged - than
we enjoyed.  How imperiled is their character by our success?  What
practical steps can we take to insure that we pass along to them the
character values that we treasure?

We plan to schedule a Harvard Forum every quarter.

Because of the format, attendance is limited.  Please respond as indicated
below.

When:    Friday, May 18, 7:30 p.m.
Where:   Briar Club, 2603 Timmons (East Briar Room)
Cost:      $35.00 per person

Reservations:  Email dottie@kerr-solutions.com or call 281/424-3084
(Payment must be made at time of reservation by credit card or mailing
check to 3413 Cobblestone Lane, Baytown, TX 77521-1956.)

For further information, contact David Grizzle (david_grizzle@yahoo.com or
713-324-2966) or Danguole Spakevicius (danguole@fempartners.com or

Thank you all for participating on the associate and analyst PRC committee.  
I believe that the PRC process is the most important tool we have to evaluate 
Enron's talent, and your role in the process is critical.  With the all 
important year-end PRC quickly approaching, I'd like to spend a little time 
with you sharing not only my philosophy on the process, but also talking 
about the mechanics of the process.  There will also be time to answer any 
questions you may have.

To that end, please join me and Charlene Jackson for breakfast on Thursday, 
November 30, at 8:30 a.m. in EB50M.  If you are unable to attend in person 
and would like to participate by conference call, that can be arranged.  
Please RSVP your attendance to Cheryl Kuehl at x3-9804.

I look forward to seeing you on November 30, and again, many thanks for 
spending your time on this critical process.

The Board of the Center for Houston=01,s Future recently committed
resoundingly to the creation of Goals and a Strategic Plan for Houston that
will allow our community to achieve its extraordinary potential over the
next decisive 20 years.  This landmark program, already underway, will be
assisted by many dedicated volunteers from throughout the community.  Led
by Chairman Gene Vaughan, the Center, an affiliate of the Greater Houston
Partnership, is focused on very tough questions:  The world and Houston are
changing rapidly - what will be the new reality in 20 years and beyond?
What do we want Houston to be?  What are the obstacles and trade-offs?
Most of all, what plans, resources, determination and leadership are
necessary now to get Houston to its desirable future?  If you are
interested in what can be done to give Houston a great future worthy of its
past - and particularly if you want to get involved - this is an
outstanding opportunity to discourse with one of the citizens leading the
charge.

Gene Vaughan is chairman and founder of Vaughan, Nelson, Scarborough &
McCullough, L.P., an investment management firm originated in Houston in
1970 whose Investment Counsel and VNSM Trust Company manage securities
portfolios for foundations, endowments, corporations and families.

Within his profession, Mr. Vaughan was founding chairman and governor of
the Association for Investment Management and Research, a past chairman of
the Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts and a past chairman of the
Financial Analysts Federation.  He is chairman and has served as a director
since 1970 of Dreyfus Founders Group of mutual funds (Denver).

Mr. Vaughan has been a trustee of Vanderbilt University (Nashville) since
1972.  He is a director since 1990 and on the Executive Committee of the
Greater Houston Partnership.  He is Chairman of the Center for Houston=01,s
Future whose mission is to help prepare Houston proactively for future
opportunities and challenges.  Mr. Vaughan is a director of the Houston
Grand Opera Association, a trustee of Goodwill Industries and past chairman
of The Houston Forum.  He was founding chairman of Presbyterian School
(early childhood through grade 8) and served as a trustee of St. John=01,s=
=20
School.

Mr. Vaughan received a B.A. in 1955 from Vanderbilt University, an M.B.A.
in 1961 from the Harvard Business School, where he was a J. Spencer Love
Fellow, and earned the Chartered Financial Analyst designation in 1969.

    Thanks so much for your involvement in the search for a fire chief.
Having suffered the lack of competent leadership this department has
experienced during my 20 year career, I offer these comments respectfully.
    This is an organization of unique people with a unique mission. Those who
lead these people need not be mission specialists but must be true leaders of
people. Because of the way fire departments grow their leaders from within,
leadership is not a quality that evolves. Authority is used in its place.
Firefighters are taught to rely on themsleves in high tide, and they do not
naturally seek information and ideas from others. Because politics won't
allow the department to operate in a similar fashion to the Marine Corpse,
authority is less than useful at the top: leadership is essential.
    None of the men who have headed this department in the last 20 years have
understood the difference between leadership and authority. They have
commanded, but not led. The importance of this difference becomes evident
once one is familiar with the problems addressed but not improved.
    The people in this department who raise their own flag high enough to be
recognized as potential chiefs do so being driven by  a combination of greed
and ego. They campaign for the job because they want it, not because they
think they can do a good job. When they take the fire chief's job, this ego
does not allow them to lead talented people. It directs them to command and
to control.
    The second major element of failure, when coupled to this egomaniacal
command style, puts the incompetence in motion. As was extremely clear with
the last chief we had, no ego check , no alter ego, no reality check was ever
allowed. None of his people were allowed to express any oppositional views or
to suggest anything differing from the chief's ideas. A true leader will more
than listen to his opponents on any issue or idea. He will welcome differing
views, knowing they might influence him in a positive way, even if only to
preserve his image as almighty. In our department we have consistently seen a
style of live or die by the chief's wishes. It's not what's best for the
citizens that comes to the fore, it's what makes everyone remember who's in
charge. I know this sounds bitter, but it's as true as it is
counterproductive.
    The above described syndrome has contributed enormously to the failures
of leadership we have seen. This department has made many mistakes laughable
to organizational psychologists, fleet management experts, and most logical
thinkers inside the department.
    This department's current state is much more problematic than Mayor Brown
either recognizes or is willing to admit. There are many troubles which make
the rank and file veterans see a terrible failure of this department to carry
out its mission in the near future. Recent status reports, though harsh, have
been too kind.
    With a leadership style in any way similar to our record, we're in
trouble. We need a leader who can address the problems we have as a
department instead of using their energy and resources to protect their own
status, to explain why problems exist instead of how they'll be addressed. We
need someone with the vision, the intellectual breadth, to see the department
as a function of society. We need someone who has some experience in the
outside world and who understands that all relevant and useful knowledge is
not already held by our department. We need someone who can recognize talent,
good ideas, and put them to use. Someone who knows what a leader means when
he tells his assistants to speak their minds, that he can agree with himself
and doesn't need them for that, but that he needs their input especially when
it differs from his own. Someone who understands and appreciates the
scientific model for solving problems, and who sees the organizational chart
with the bottom at the top so that the leaders are there to support as they
direct. Someone who leads people to do the right thing because they want to,
not because they have to. Someone who will say that things are not all right
and here's what we're going to do to improve them.
    Perhaps you will keep an eye out for these qualities and we might have a
real leader for a change, instead of just a chief.
    Thanks again for your work on this and good luck.

Thanks for the response.  Our next dinner is scheduled for September 25, at
the moment I'm not sure who the other invitees would be.  Jerry would
probably have a better idea as he puts together the guest list for each

Probably the best thing is for the call to go ahead, that way Jerry can
brief Mr. Skilling on our plans for the remaining dinners throughout the

19 and will be held in Aspen, Colorado.  The Current State of the Global
Market will be one of the topics under discussion and Jack Welch of GE is
one of your fellow invitees.

The purpose of your conversation with Mr. Murdock is to discuss the above
in
more detail and to more fully brief you on the purpose of these dinners.

Please do not hesitate to contact me should you require any further
information.

meeting our nominations from the Judy/Joanne/Janice reservoirs.

Up until recent CATS maintenance shutdown on 15 May, they were making up for 
reduced production volumes by nominating to supply gas at the NBP which they 
are entitled but not obliged to do.  Since return from outage at the end of 
May they have declined to nominate at the NBP.  

From 1 January to 15 May, the Sellers use of the NBP delivery option kept 
underdeliveries to 350 mmcf (ie one day's maximum quantity) in total.  Since 
returning from the maintenance shutdown, underdeliveries have totalled 850 
mmcf ( averaging 77mcf/d ).

We believe that following the sharp rise in market prices during the 
maintenance period, they have decided to default on the contract rather than 
make up deliveries from other sources.   They have an effective cap on the 
penalties of about 5 pence per therm (after taking into account the value of 
the liquids) and therefore they are not making up the volumes when the daily 
price is substantially higher than about 16 pence per therm.

Prior to the CATS shutdown, we had made them a proposal to enable them to 
deliver additional volumes at  another alternative to avoid default but they 
have not responded yet.

You mentioned that in your negotiations with Phillips they had committed to 
getting us all the gas regardless of the cap on the penalties.  This has cost 
us about $1.5 million to date and they seem to be institutionalising their 
non performance.    Perhaps a phone call by you might help.  

By the way I will be in Houston on Thursday and Friday to meet with the 
delegation from Croatia and I will probably be tied up the entire time but if 
you need me

    Good Friday Morning - Comments From The
Local Guys!

Economic data so far this quarter has been extremely ambiguous. On the one
hand, the employment figures released last Friday were soft, with net hiring
shrinking for the second consecutive month and the unemployment rate rising
to 4.5%. On the other hand, consumer sentiment has improved, and the April
retail sales figures were stronger than anticipated. As we have mentioned,
this mixed data has increased the odds the Federal Reserve will ease by only
25bp next Tuesday. At this stage, Lehman Brothers' economists still think
the odds favor a 50bp cut, given the underlying weakness in the economy,
particularly in high-tech and manufacturing, together with the abysmal
employment data.

The change in the perception on the strength of the economy can be seen in
the higher interest rates posted below.

The 30-year US T-Bond yield is 5.87%.
The 10-year yield is 5.47%.
The 5-year is trading at 4.98%.
Spot crude oil is trading at $28.62 p/b.
Natural Gas - Henry Hub -  is trading at $4.27 p/mcf.

   AD Time:

New Federal Insider-Trading Rule (Rule 10b5-1) have been adopted by the SEC
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This rule greatly enhances an
insider's/employee's ability to trade his/her corporate shares during
blackout periods.
Previously, without the protection of this new SEC rule, employees and
insiders could safely trade only outside of designated blackout windows.
Under this new rule, insiders/employees may have the ability to purchase and
sell their corporate shares even during blackout periods if a written plan
was established and in force when the insider/employee was not in possession
of material, non-public information.
The new rule contains other restrictions and should be reviewed carefully.

Lehman Brothers has established a turn-key plan that take into account the
regulatory procedures for establishing such a plan.    Please email us or
call us for more information.

IMPACT CALLS

Entertainment S. Linde, .212.526.4009
Upfront Preview: CBS and FOX Appear Well Positioned
*With the WGA negotiations all but settled, the Entertainment industry will
now turn its sights to the upfront selling cycle, which
commences May 14 with presentations from the major Networks lasting through
May 17.
*The current ad market has created fears of a weak upfront market. Ad buyers
must be careful not to look at the current economic
environment as a proxy for the future. Based on this premise, there may be
upside to our 5%-10% estimated decline in upfront sales
(based on 65%-70% inventory sales with low to mid single digit price
increases).
*In our opinion, VIAB and FOX are the best positioned for this year's
upfront given that improved ratings in the key 18-49
demographic combined with our expectation for modest CPM increases will
boost unit pricing.

Rank 2 2
*On May 21, Reebok will be hosting an investor day in Canton, Massachusetts.
We believe that this event should be highly
informative as investors will have the opportunity to view the crucial back
to school product line as well as hear several key
executive presentations.
*We expect to hear presentations from David Perdue, a Reebok veteran and
recently appointed president of the Reebok brand, Jay
Margolis, president of the specialty division (Rockport, Ralph Lauren
footwear and Greg Norman brands) and Terry Pillow,
President of the Rockport brand, among others.
*We will also be looking for additional information on the company's new NFL
licensing deal, which could generate $200 million and
be accretive by $0.05 in 2002 (included in our 2002 estimate).
*We believe that an inflection point in the stock could be the 3Q01, where
we are estimating $60 million of NFL revenues. This
incremental revenue should aid in 12% overall revenue growth for RBK.

*Our meeting with senior management yesterday confirmed that demand for
STOR's services remains strong; we believe that the stock
is still undervalued at current levels despite its recent rise.
*STOR's management stated that the pipeline of activity for new customers
continues to be robust and that its current customer base is
also growing.
*We believe that STOR is benefiting from the increasing complexity of
managing enterprise data storage environments.
*We believe STOR is funded to profitability.
*The company's maturing sales force should lead to continued productivity
gains. In addition, STOR is shifting its revenue mix to
higher margin services.
*We believe that the stock overhang stemming from the lock-up expiration is
largely behind us.
*Despite its recent run, the stock is still trading at a discount to its
peer group.

McDonald's Corp(MCD) 1 - Strong Buy M. Speiser, .212.526.3255

FY: 12/31 Price Target $38 $38
Rank 1 1
*Our lower EPS view is not based on weakening Operations, but is due to
adjustments to our share base & interest expense estimates.
So we do not expect much impact on the stock. Lowering already-weak EPS
expectations will likely prove to be beneficial for the
stock. Maintain Op outlook
*Reducing our '01 EPS view from $1.50 to $1.46, now flat vs. a yr-ago & the
low on the Street
*Our revision reflects adjustments to our share base & interest expense
estimates. With $1.2b in buyback targeted in '01 & $452m
done in 1Q, our previous forecast reflected more aggressive repo; mgmt is
adamant that '01 buyback would not pass $1.2b. Also,
higher debt levels will not likely be offset by weak currencies as much as
we thought
*Imp'rtantly our Op outlook albeit weak is unchanged
*Maintain 1-rating. We're now confident that our '01 EPS view will not be
lowered anymore. With the shares at a 4+ year valuation
low & the bar on expectations very low, the risk/reward is favorable

Rank 1 1
*Yesterday IBM hosted its annual meeting for security analysts in New York.
While there were no major surprises, CEO Lou Gerstner
did outline some trends for the future, and stressed the importance of
innovation and integration (i.e., Technology and Services) for
the company going forward.
*Gerstner emphasized the importance of services as a driving force in all IT
spending, including hardware and software. Gerstner also
cited the need for continued technological development as a way to avoid
price wars driven by commoditization of products.
*Gerstner stressed IBM's commitment to high single-digit revenue growth and
double-digit earnings growth in the future. Gerstner
indicated that the company would not simply grow revenue at any cost, but
was instead focused on EPS and cash flow driven by an
operational execution.
*We maintain our current estimates and reiterate our 1-Strong Buy rating on
IBM shares.
IT Consulting & Computer Services K. Keirstead, .212.526.0442
Gerstner's View of IT Services
*Yesterdays comments from the CEO Lou Gerstner and the head of IBM Global
Services Doug Elix represent positive long-term
statements about the IT services industry. IBM is positioning itself as a
services-lead company and claimed that the services business
is now the most important segment of the technology sector. The meeting
supports our positive view of EDS while the comments
about the consulting and systems integration market make us incrementally
more worried about Sapient and Computer Sciences.

Electronic Arts(ERTS) 3 - Market Perform F. Kantor, .212.526.5562

Mkt Cap: $7.6B EPS 2002 N/A $1.71E $1.74E 31.9
FY: 3/31 Price Target N/A N/A
Rank 3 3
*There is no doubt in our minds that ERTS is one of the premier publishers
in the industry. The co's solid performance in a difficult Q
makes it easy to believe that when hurdles are absent (i.e. an abundance of
game consoles) they can outperform. That said, we wish
the stock were not so pricey. Due to valuation, we reiterate our market
perform.
*1Q01 operating EPS of $(0.09) vs $0.08 were better than our $(0.15) est.
Most of the upside came from EA Core, where in line revs
were bolstered by lower op. exp. At EA.com, slightly higher revs were offset
by lower margins.
*We are raising our consol. FY02E to $0.89 from $0.84 and are initiating
quarterly EPS of $(0.13), $(0.05), $0.87 and $0.20. We are
also initiating a consol. FY03E EPS of $1.71.
*Adjusting for EA.com, ERTS currently trades at a forward P/E of 35.3x -
higher than hist averages. Though ERTS is on the cusp of
solid growth, this valuation indicates that it is currently in the stock.

*IDEC expects to answer the FDA's questions on Zevalin by mid-July. Our

*The FDA has issued a Complete Review Letter on Zevalin, asking IDEC to
address a number of clinical and CMC issues.
*The FDA is not requiring additional Phase III trials or further imaging on
patients for the BLA submission.
*The timing for Zevalin at the FDA remains a question. There are currently
no completion requirements for the FDA, although we are
clearly encouraged by IDEC's ability to respond quickly.
*We continue to expect launch in 1Q02. We maintain our sales projections for
Zevalin in 2002 and 2003 at $70.9 million and $119.8
million, respectively.

 His name is Richard Heidecker, who was sending e-mails to Joe.  Mr. 
Heidecker claimed that he was fired from Enron because of an alleged 
disability.  Our investigation determined that there was no merit to his 
allegation.  However, Mr. Heidecker continued to attempt communications with 
Joe.  I felt that it was prudent  to alert OOC by the message below not to

Subject: Employee Communications with OOC

Ken/Jeff/Joe:

 As you may know, I have recently been hired to direct the new Office of 
Labor and Employment Relations (formerly Fair Employment and Labor 
Practices).  One of the many major roles of my group is to conduct 
investigations into employee allegations of discrimination, harassment, and 
other unfair treatment. One recent investigation involved an employee who was 
communicating via e-mail with your office on a constant and unyielding 
basis.  As experience shows, this is not an uncommon occurrence as some 
employees feel that they must go to the top to get attention.

 As you have been doing, please direct all such employee communications to me 
for prompt processing.  This will enable you to avoid being subjected to 
depositions and trial testimony in any subsequent legal proceeding as a fact 
witness.  Naturally, I will keep you informed as to the results of the 
investigation to any extent that you desire.

 Please let me know if you have any questions, comments, or concerns.

Brian

Saturday - March 31 - Columbus - 8:00 AM - 56 miles - (hilly)
Here is the Conoco series, sponsored by Steve Moskowitz - This is ride #12, 
and there are 14 in the series, at a cost of $20 total.  Questions:  Patrick 
Scales at Enron - 713-345-3673.

You read the note right - it says we're starting from COLUMBUS, Tx!

Sorry this note is a day late and still missing a key detail - the exact
starting location - but due to the Round Top/Warrenton Antique Fair (100,000
visitors/day), we felt we needed to modify our route this Saturday.  There
is a hilly 56 mile route which starts in Columbus and covers many of the
same challenging hills as the ride originally planned but stays away from
Round Top, Warrenton, and Fayetteville and the busy roads immediately around
these towns.

Weekly Ride - Columbus, TX, Sat, 3/31 - 8 am

This week, we'll still get our hill training in and will have the
opportunity to climb the same hill (Lone Oak) that we would have had to
climb on the New Ulm route.  This ride is a 56 mile loop starting in
Columbus, hitting Lone Oak and Frelsburg and picking up beautiful
Zimmerscheidt Road going the other direction.  The Rides Around Houston book
gives this ride a score of ""9"" for exercise potential so look for some
hills.

The ride will start at 8:00 am sharp.  Columbus is an hour from the Sam
Houston Tolway/I-10 intersection so please allow yourself time to arrive in
Columbus by 7:15 am.

Directions to the Start - Beason's Park
We have permission to use Beason's Park as the starting off point.  Someone
is using the pavilion from 2:00pm to 7:00pm, and I told Judy that most of us
would be gone by then and we didn't really need the pavilion.  Beason's Park
does have restrooms, however, I will not vouch for the condition.

Beason's park is on US 90 just east of Columbus.  The most direct way is to
take I-10 to exit 698 (US 90 exit) and take US 90 west.  The park is on the
left hand side of the road just before the bridge over the Colorado river.
For those of you (like us) coming from Magnolia/The Woodlands the best way
is to take FM 949 to I-10.  We stay on the feeder which becomes US 90 at
exit 698.

If you want to pick up food or go to the bathroom before the ride, stay on
I-10 until exit 696 (Hwy 71).  There are convenience stores and bathrooms at
this exit.  At this point you can either take Hwy 71 north to US 90 and turn
right (east) to get to the park (which will be on your right just after the
bridge) or get back on I-10 to exit 698.

NOTE - As we get out into the country, I highly recommend stopping at the
local stores for your sport drinks, water, and a quick rest stop.  Your
drinks will be colder this way, you will have a timely rest stop, and the
local business will look forward to our return.

Here's a few reminders for those of you who are new to the list or have a
short memory:

Starting Time - 8:00 am - SHARP!
There were a lot of riders pulling into Cat Springs at 7:55 last Saturday.
If you arrive in Columbus after 7:30 and aren't fast at bike prep and
signing in, you'll get left at the start this week.  PLEASE allow time to
get to Columbus between 7:15 and 7:30.  Even though we're not riding to
Warrenton, we want to be off the roads as early as possible.

Check-in Process
Every rider is expected to sign in to indicate that they have started the
ride and sign-out on their return.  We have no way of knowing that you are
on the road and may need assistance if you don't sign in.  PLEASE arrive
early enough to sign in and remember to sign out when you finish the ride.

If you have completed the online or paper waiver, your name will appear on
the alphabetical sign-in sheets.  They are split up into groups of 5-6
sheets to speed up the sign in process so look for the clip board with your
name.  If this is your first ride and you haven't signed up online, you need
to complete a paper waiver and fill in your name on the blank sign-in sheet.
If you completed a paper waiver last Saturday and your name is not listed on
the alpha list, it's because you didn't sign the waiver (3 of you), you
signed one but didn't provide any emergency information, or I just couldn't
read your handwriting (5 VERY sloppy waivers last week!).  PLEASE arrive
early enough to fill out a legible waiver or slow down a minute when filling
it out.

I hate to harp on these details but it is vital that everyone help out to
ensure that you have a safe and fun ride.

Thanks!

corporate profits.

Showing the way will be IP expert lawyers from New York's premier IP law

Enjoy Alaska, dad.

Thanks for keeping in touch.  By the way, will be in SF starting late
October 21.  Unfortunately will have to spend quite a bit of time I'm afraid
finding new tenant, as the old one (who's been great) is moving out after a
year.  Wish me luck.

Keeping pretty well informed here.  Don't expect things to get too bad, at
least in the sense that I'll be suffering any serious deprevations.  This is
a big, cosmopolitan city (perhaps, in some ways, the most cosmopolitan city
in the world), which in many ways is quite modern (in its own, primitive
way).  Its got plenty of McDonalds, for instance, at which I can (Allah
forbid) stiffle any hunger pangs.  My friends Ismail and Sukran are looking
out for me as well, and for example talked me into staying out doors for two
of the three nights following the quake.

Its raining now and has cooled down considerably, which is great for me but
a very mixed blessing for those trying to get things somewhat back together
east and west of here.  Wish them luck. God, what a horrible thing.  Just
horrible.  I feel guilty that things in my life so normal.  And things
really are, for all practical purposes, back to normal.  How strange.

Say hey to mom.  Have heard little from or about her recently.  Is all ok?

Love,

Mark

with EnCom, as well as what I am doing to develop a plan for the way forward 
with our investment.

Background

As you may be aware, Enron made its investment in EnCom in October 1999.  
Bruce Wrobel is President/CEO.  Our current cumulative investment is now 
$34,750,000.  We own 63.80 %, and have the right to put 5 members on a board 
of nine.  There are two other strategic, Japanese investors in the business; 
Orix, primarily known as a leasing firm, and YTC, primarily a parts supplier 
for Toyota.  Enron Japan (EJ) in particular values Orix as a strategic 
partner even beyond the context of EnCom (a fact that was reconfirmed when 
Ken Lay met with their Chairman during his recent week in Tokyo).  

At present, the relationship between EnCom (its vehicle for doing business in 
Japan is E Power; and I will use the two terms interchangeably) and EJ is a 
difficult one.  EnCom entered the Japanese market some months before EJ 
entered, and EnCom was seen in the market as Enron's entry vehicle for 
Japan.  I infer that EnCom has benefited from this association with the Enron 
name, and Enron apparently did not discourage it in the early days.  With the 
arrival of EJ in Tokyo early this year, Enron is working to roll out our 
wholesale/merchant business model in Japan.  EnCom/E Power has and continues 
to receive coverage in the media (much of it self-generated) indicating that 
they intend to sign up customers.  In fact, E Power's COO Mr. Awono, says 
that they will need to sign up retail customers to be able to have load to 
support the large power projects they are planning to do.  (This unlikely 
formula suggests, at least on his part, a degree of naivete, at best, about 
how offtake from plants in deregulated markets can be and should be 
managed.).  Finally, EJ reports meeting with customers, e.g., Sony, who 
indicate that E Power holds itself out as also being a ""trader"".  This has 
caused some confusion in the marketplace about which ""Enron"" entity is 
providing wholesale/merchant services.  

There now also is a question as to what EnCom's business model in Japan 
should be.  Conversations between Orix and EJ personnel in Tokyo suggest that 
Orix believed that Enron would be intimately involved in the day-to-day 
management of EnCom (we are not, and Bruce has conceded that prior to EJ's 
reporting relationship into London being established, Enron involvement and 
direction was largely absent).  Moreover, it appears that Orix also believed 
that EnCom would be engaged in the business of ""aggregation"" of power 
supplies for further resale in the Japanese market (this is essentially 
describing the core Enron merchant business in different terms).  
Conversations between Orix and EJ indicate that Orix now does not see EnCom 
having in place the people and skills to execute on an aggregation business 
strategy.  Rather, Orix sees EnCom as having the skill sets of large-scale 
asset developers, and this is not a business Orix is particularly interested 
in pursuing.  Finally, Orix has an employee secunded to EnCom/E Power, and he 
reports that Orix now even lacks confidence in EnCom's ability to deliver any 
large-scale asset development opportunities.  John and I are tentatively 
scheduled to meet Orix's Chairman in London on 27th November.

To give E Power its due, it is now also frustrated (Wrobel telephone 
conversation with me) because Ken Lay clearly signaled in some of his media 
interviews in Tokyo that we were bringing the full panoply of Enron skills to 
the market, including the possibility of large-scale power projects.  It is 
Wrobel's view that this message in the marketplace now undercuts EnCom, as he 
believes that people will look to a $60 billion market cap company as a 
preferred counterparty for asset development, over a company capitalised at 
present to the tune of about $40 million.  There is also a Business 
Opportunities Agreement between EnCom and EJ addressing how opportunities 
that come to Enron personnel, who are also on EnCom's Board, should be 
handled.    Wrobel believes that we are being a bit narrow in our 
interpretation of the Business Opportunities Agreement, a view I do not 
share. Ken's statements are correct, i.e., we can do large-scale developments 
in JapanIn sum, there is not an agreement as to a clear division of lines of 
business between the two organisations.

At present, frustrations on both sides about confusion in the marketplace and 
in media messages (EnCom has now agreed that Enron will lead all contacts 
with the media, for both firms), have contributed to a situation that is not 
amicable.  Communications in Tokyo between EJ and E Power have virtually 
dried up, though recently EJ has invited E Power to work together on a 
Proposal for Mitsubishi.   

So Where Are We?

John has asked me to lead an effort to evaluate Enron's investment in EnCom.  
This will be fairly comprehensive, including an assessment of the talent on 
the ground in Tokyo, an assessment of the viability of their prospects (both 
in terms of likelihood of permitting, and, to the extent possible, their 
economics), and an assessment of what Enron's stake in this venture ought to 
be going forward.  I will evaluate the full range, from assuming 100% 
control, to a reduced stake (even down to zero), to taking equity in 
particular projects.  As such, I have sent to Wrobel a list of items 
reflecting our initial information requirements for due diligence.  

Second, while this due diligence proceeds, we are also attempting to agree on 
respective roles for EnCom and EJ in the Japanese market.  We remain 
committed to retaining an asset development capability in the market, which 
does not go down well with Wrobel.  We also are sceptical that EnCom has on 
board now, or will acquire, the risk management skills that we believe will 
be necessary to actually manage fuel and offtake along the lines that Enron 
has found highly profitable, e.g., Sutton Bridge tolling.  We have said that 
we respect their talent for being able to develop large-scale assets (though 
our Technical Services Group has already questioned their high staffing 
levels), and that we feel the profit-maximising strategy for both firms is 
for EnCom to develop projects (sites, permits, engineering), with Enron 
holding a tolling agreement and doing the project financing.  We believe E 
Power should be able to develop very bankable deals on this basis.  We do not 
have agreement on this point.  Wrobel seemingly believes that they will be 
able to do the risk management functions, and receive lucrative returns for 
the assets they do develop.  At this early stage we see no evidence that they 
can manage such risks (or that lenders would let them do that), and that it 
is more likely that they will end up with a classic IPP structure with gas 
""in"", PPA ""out"", and reasonable but not rich returns on equity.  Wrobel sees 
our ""tolling agreement"" proposition as taking too much out of EnCom's deals.  
For our part, we have said we are willing to assure attractive equity returns 
(without saying what that number is), and reward them for their development 
efforts.

Our latest effort is to try to agree a tolling arrangement for a project in 
Tohoku province.  E Power has already met local officials.  As it turns out, 
EJ was approached by national government to do a project at the same 
industrial complex as that which E Power is working on.  By letter from me to 
Wrobel of 15 November, Enron has proposed that we pool or combine our efforts 
(i.e., E Power's engineering and local permitting expertise, with Enron's 
political capital garnered at national level), get the project done together 
rather than competing, and divide our labours as noted above, i.e., Enron 
does fuel and off-take, E Power does development of the asset.  In the phone 
call from me to Wrobel that preceded the sending of the letter, Wrobel 
expressed serious displeasure with Enron's proposal.  He and I are to speak 
again; he is to call me back, and if he does not do so on 17 November, I will 
call him on 20 November.         

I will plan to make progress on my wider review assuming cooperation from 
EnCom on our due diligence information requirements.  John and I are 
committed to moving this forward quickly, but much of the necessary 
information is not in hand. 

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Enron Corp
Jeffrey Skilling


Dear Jeffrey,

I'm writing in regards to your online strategy and in particular how you plan 
to build and scale your emerging online business and relationships.  
E-Business Relationships can mean a lot of things.  At it's core, it is 
understanding the needs of your customers, partners, and employees 
(collectively, your Business Community), and getting the right content to the 
right person to generate the greatest impact in the most timely and effective 
manner possible.

Strong e-Relationships increase retention rates, conversion rates and drive 
long term loyalty.  The idea is to make the internet your Business 
Communities' preferred channel for completing a transaction that is being 
offered, whether that is completing a support call, buying a product, 
registering for an event or service, enabling partner success, managing an 
account, training, or just acquiring information.

As Enron Corp looks ahead, it is important to continue to better understand 
who your Business Community are and in turn build online relationships with 
them.  Studies have shown that companies spend five times more on attracting 
new customers than on retaining the customers they have.  Attracting new 
employees can cost 10 times more than retaining existing employees, and in 
the energy business your reputation with your partners is critical to your 
success.

Vignette is the undisputed leader in Value Chain and eRelationship Management 
with the most robust platform, applications and services offerings in the 
industry.  With over 1200 customers, Vignette is helping our customers 
create, manage and automate their online relationships.  The Vignette 
Platform enables our customers to manage and automate the flow of information 
from their back office to their front office, from their suppliers to their

his wedding.

I am coming to Houston next week and have a 1:30 appt on the 15th.  with
Bill Donovan to demonstrate what we do...long story but he is excited to see

Happy birthday.  So, it sounds like you will be ""batching"" it on your
birthday this year.

Read a little about the Sox here; sounds like they're up and down.

Good luck on your speech on Memorial day.  What will it be about?

How was the Lehigh frat reunion?  Are you really playing golf already?
There arn't very many courses here, but did see one recently (it was, of
course, owned by the army).

Hope mom wins the sweepstakes, and the trip to Istanbul. When is the
drawing?  (Did she get my note about mom's day?)

I brag to everyone here about you getting a computor and learning how to use
the Internet; its really quite extraordinay.  Great to be in such good touch
with you all.  Hope to get a connection to my apartment again in late June,
after which I should be able to write more regularly.

Of yeah, Misha and wife Nina coming to Istanbul in a couple of weeks.  Plan
to head out into Anatolia (Asian Turkey) for a week.  Should be great.  Will
get to seriously test my Turkish.  Looking forward to it.

Talk with you soon.

Love,

Jeff,

I am preparing a report here for a client about foreign companies'
experiences here in Turkey.  I was wondering if it would be ok for me to
contact someone involved with Enron=01,s Turkey operation.  I suspect that =
any
such information is confidential, or at least sensitive, but if not, would
be very interesitng.  Please do not hesitate to say a big loud no.  Just

Hope all else goes well.  We should plan on talking on the phone sometime

Sorry that I missed the get together at SMU last month, but from the
looks of the photos I've seen, a good time was had by all. Hope this
finds you healthy and doing well. My wife and I had dinner last night
with Tom and Betsy McSoley, and your name came up in conversation while
talking about the reunion. I wanted to touch base with you with a
possible business start up idea that may fit into the types of online
services you offer with Enron. We are currently developing an online
licensing agency for the illustration and photographic markets, and I
would like to share the idea and our business plan with you to see if
there is any interest in what promises to be a growing marketplace.
While some companies are currently involved in the photographic end of
this business environment (GettyImages, Corbis), we feel we have a
competitive advantage in that our management team consists of some of
the top illustrators in the field as well as two of the best
intellectual attorneys in the country. We currently have 250 artists and
their collective body of work signed up, and are now in the capital
raising stage, with a launch date of June 2001. I'd love the opportunity
to talk with you further if you think this might be of interest to you.
When time permits, please give me a call at 317 253 3141 and I'd be
happy to share more with you at that time. Thanks for giving this your
consideration Rocky, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to 
Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this 
weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise 
$50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you 
consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...

Sherri :-)

Mr. Skilling,

I was compelled to contact you by the following information:
While reading eCompany Magazine March Issue, I came across the following
quote from Jeff Skilling CEO of Enron.

""Keeping the system up. You dread the chance the system will crash. We had
an air conditioning problem last April or May, and went down.
The next day the front page of Gas Daily Journal had a story that said ""Gas
trading stops because Enron online is down.""""

Netbotz offers early warning to just that type of failure and more.
http://www.netbotz.com

Mr. Skilling who would I contact at Enron to make them aware of a product
with a sub $1000. price tag to prevent those issues in the future?

biggest non-news news of the millennium - Judge Jackson ruled to break-up
Mr. Softee.  MSFT sold off initially (after being up small on the day) but
is trading up over 2 as I write this (5:45PM NY Time).  Gates is defiant and
feels that things will go his way on appeal - he might be right but given
Mr. Bill's penchant for seeming arrogant it was abit odd to see him as the
front man dismissing questions about the naming of the second company as if
it were completely out of the realm of possibility.  A more tempered, less
emotional, less personal response might have been abit more comforting for
stockholders - many people feel Mr. Bill's hubris got them into this mess to
begin with - look at INTC and CSCO - they know when to tip their hat at
Uncle Sam and stay out of the court room.  The key is the restrictions which
are supposed to go into effect in 90 days - Gates feels very very very very
confident that they will be thrown out and Mr. Softee will suffer no harm
during the appeal - evidentially many after hours traders share his view.
They seem unconcerned of the threat to the new MSFT net strategy - which is
to be announced at the end of June.  In the broader markets - it was a
reversal of yesterday with financials and tech on the rebound (IBM, ORCL,
HWP, SUNW, C, BAC, AXP, LEH, BSC, AMTD...) and utilities and energy falling
to profit taking (XOM, BPA, RD, WMB, PCG, CPL....).  In the CEUT Universe -
it was a mixed bag - ITWO* up over 11, MANU* (which was down over 5) closed
in the green - Catherine Moore spoke inter-day and said the sellers were
wrong..... AMCC* down almost 10, KOPN* down almost 3 1/2, PMCS* down over 2
but SSTI* up over 7.... BRCD* up over 10 1/2, NTAP* & PRCM up over 4...
MUSE* up over 4, VRTS* up over 9.... TMPW up over 3... GMH* down over 8 1/2,
XMSR* up 1/2, PGTV* down over 6 1/2... IMAN+ up almost 1...   In IPO-land
GCBF never came but UbiquiTel (UPCS), a wireless service provider associated
with Sprint PCS,  came at 8 (below original range) and closed down almost 4%
- not great but given these markets.... tomorrow is the PPI # - if shows
soft on inflation then the feeling is the Fed will not raise in June.

MSFT's Ballmer - in Europe - echoes Gates defiant stand at press conf. in
Europe.

T - backing off on long dist. hikes/ also testing multiple ISPs on cable
system in Colo.

SNE - delaying US dig. TV debut/ also portable version of Playstation to

These are truly outstanding accomplishments and our expectations for growth=
=20
and opportunity in Enron North America for 2001 are consistent with that=20
success.  In order to reach these goals, we felt it necessary to re-align a=
=20
number of our organizations. A number of these changes are completed.  The=
=20
goals of such re-alignment include:
a) increase overall productivity with the goal to ensure that every employe=
e=20
is in a position to contribute regardless of skill set;
b) increase overall market coverage, deal flow and information generation=
=20
with the goal to increase bid/offer income, increase the velocity of deal=
=20
flow, improve customer coverage and promote quality information transfer to=
=20
our trading organization;
c) increase deal quality and earnings quality with the goal to (i) allocate=
=20
our resources towards the best transactions and (ii) significantly increase=
=20
our =01&mid-market=018 originated transactions in our portfolio;
d) promote real time decision making and a closer tie between our trading a=
nd=20
origination (mid-market and structured) organizations in order to better=20
align those functions to reduce the amount of un-productive internal focus;
e) increase the overall velocity of the capital being utilized consistent=
=20
with our goal of a 25% plus return on capital employed; and
f) identify and recognize a host of new leaders in the organization that ar=
e=20
critical to meeting our goals next year.

With these objectives in mind, patterned after the successful business mode=

Texas Gas =01) the Texas Gas Team will be managed by Tom Martin. This team =

industrial accounts where relationships are well formed. Otherwise,=20
mid-market coverage will gravitate to the regions. The New York office gas=

marketing efforts will continue to be managed by Fred.
Upstream Products =01) this group, lead by Jean Mrha, will develop several=

distinct product offerings for the upstream segment of the gas market.  Thi=
s=20
group will develop and market the product in conjunction with the regions.=
=20
This is consistent with our desire to have a broader product offering and=

producer outsourcing, similar to our successful Petro-Canada and Suncor=20
relationships in Canada, physical storage re-engineering, compressor=20
services, wellhead liquidity products and offshore asset and capital=20
products.  In addition, Jean will manage our Bridgeline joint venture with=

Texaco. =20
Gas Structuring =01) this group will be lead by Ed McMichael, reporting to =
Frank=20
Vickers, will provide structuring and deal support to all the gas teams.
Gas Fundamentals =01) this group will be lead by Chris Gaskill, reporting t=

asked Janet Dietrich to coordinate such overlaps between the two=20
organizations in Houston.=20

e) Technical/Restructuring - In the effort to consolidate and centralize ou=

the contractual protections TGS has in the event of a devaluation.  

Long and short of it is - 

Argentina's economy is primarily dollarized and it would appear that a 
devaluation would do considerable short term harm to the economy. 

Convertibility Law was enacted in 1991.  Large part of the population 
remembers the super inflation of 1989 and 1990.

To devalue the currency, Argentina would have to amend the Convertibility Law 
- this requires  approval of the Federal Congress.

TGS has numerous layers of protection from a devaluation - in addition to the 
Convertibility law, it has protection through its license and regulations.  
Indeed, as you remembered, the tariff is indexed to the exchange rate.

A concern is - to the extent the Government takes action as drastic as 
changing the Convertibility Law to implement a devaluation, and it is willing 
to suffer the short term economic and political harm of a devaluation - then 
there is a reasonable chance they would go the extra step and find a way 
delink the tariffs of the privatized regulated companies from the dollar.    
In this case Enron would have protection under the BIT treaty.

The impact on Enron's P&L is a function of whether or not we use the Peso as 
the functional currency.  If we use the Peso as the functional currency - 
Enron would have a signficant negative translation adjustment from a 
devaluation.  If we use the dollar as the functional currency - there would 
be no impact on our income statement.   I will research this further in order 
to ensure we can use the dollar as a our functional currency.

spend a night in Iskenderun on the coast, or might head back to Istanbul via
Ankara (where I hope to spend a day) by train.

Antakya formally named Antioch, of great import to Christian history.  (If
you look on  a map, I'm in the that finger of land that extends down from
Turkey between Syria and the Mediterranean.)  Not much in the town of great
beauty; mostly just modern, cement based, instantly aged, utilitarian styled
buildings.  Things stitched together, rickety, somewhat polluted.  The town,
however, surrounded by impressive mountains.  Have met a young Arab man, who
has shown me around (saw some spectacular thousand year old ruins (build by
Christians; destroyed by Muslims) on top of a mountain not far from here,
from which vantage point we could look out over the Mediterranean (and a
setting sun) and also to the south at a snow capped mountain that stood
between us and nearby Syria).  Last night joined him and his friends.  We
ate this heavenly kebab wrapped in thin, fried (in olive oil) unleaven bread
(the whole thing called Durum), then I watched as they played a card game
akin to Bridge.  (Did you know that Bridge was invented in Istanbul some 150
years ago by a few British soldiers stationed there during the Crimean War?
The name came from the fact they crossed the Galata Bridge [not far from my
place] each evening.  [Florence Nightingale (sp?) also stationed in Istanbul
during that same war, which was when she made her name.]) Two of the players
were Christian, one was Turk and the fourth my ""new"" Arab friend.  This
provence, Hatay, is apparently the most diverse one here in Turkey, in an
ethnic, cultural, religious sense.

Boat ride over from Cyprus an ordeal.  Seas rough.  Took twice as long (4
hours instead of 2) as advertized.  I got worried when the stewards passed
out small plastic bags as we left port.  I lasted about an hour and a half
before I used mine, but was part of a vast majority of fellow suffers.  I
guess I didn't inherent sea legs for my old man.

More later,

Love,

Mark

firm McKinsey & Company, is conducting a large study of global corporations, 
their management practices, and organization.  Enron is participating in the 
project in order to learn how our own practices and activities compare to 
those of other leading global firms and to see which bring true benefits in 
the global marketplace.  One of the unique features of the project is that it 
seeks to assess the knowledge and communication networks within a company by 
asking employees throughout the company to comment on their actual practices 
and experience.  The goal is to obtain real and accurate information by 
surveying the people most directly involved in the company's operations. 

I would like to ask you to help us in getting the most out of our 
participation in the GLOBE Initiative by completing the GLOBE Network 
Survey.  The survey is brief and should take no longer than 15 or 20 
minutes.  Your responses will be treated as strictly confidential, and will 
be used solely by the Stanford/McKinsey researchers to evaluate how specific 
practices and structures impact global communication and knowledge flows.  If 
you would like individual feedback on how your own networks compare to those 
of others in the study, please check the appropriate box at the end of the 
survey.  

Please save this email for future reference and, again, thank you for 
contributing to this important learning opportunity.

I am wakened by the approaching chatter of the early morning call to
prayer (sounding a bit like the fuss made by one of those cartoon balls
of fighting dogs and cats).  From the minarets of far away mosques, the
muezzins' cries ricochet through Istanbul's still dark alleys and
streets.  Seagulls, who have drifted up the hill from the Golden Horn,
squawk contentedly outside my window.  From somewhere down below, a
miserable dog joins into the pre-dawn ruckus, soon followed by the local
muezzin, whose amplified singing drowns out all the rest.  He reminds us
that God is great and that prayer is a whole lot more important than
sleep (at least that's what I've been told; he sings in Arabic).
Because my religion thinks more highly of sleep, I feel free to simply
listen, while gently trying to pull the warm blanket of sleep back over
me.  The  muezzin has a beautiful voice.  Its rise and fall stitches
itself into the edges of a dream (in which a former best friend and I
argue about the rules of a game of miniature golf) hanging just out of
reach.

Slowly, the banal calculations that fill my days begin to crowd their
way into my head.  It's about a quarter to six, I figure, which means
there's time for a bit of writing, or even Turkish vocabulary, before I
douse myself in the shower to full consciousness.  I remind myself of
the theory that one can write most freely while still intoxicated with
sleep (or just plain intoxicated), am immediately stricken with the fear
I am incapable of such freedom, take a look round my brain for something
worth writing about (find nothing), hypothesize about the advantages of
a quick dash into the hallway to turn on the gas heater (so that when I
really get up it will be reasonably warm out there), wonder if I really
do have enough stuff prepared to fill up the two hours of my English
lesson with Suleyman, conclude that all this thinking has probably made
any more sleep impossible, then (I realize later) fall back to sleep.

My new phone [(212) 292-6486] is hooked up and I have a new internet
server, which will make it much easier to keep in touch.  Hope to attack
that backlog of responses that are due.

Jay,

I've always taken a pretty laid back approach to the noncompete when there is 
little overlap.  Having said that, however, I'd like to keep a ""last veto"" 
right - just give me a call when you've got something.

Good luck to you in the future, Jay.  You'll be missed at Enron.

Subject: My Resignation, and a Question

Jeff-

As you may know, I have (somewhat reluctantly) decided to resign from Enron.  
For some time now, I have wanted to take some time off, and had asked Whalley 
about the possibility for a six month unpaid, unvested sabbatical.  Primarily 
for reasons of precedence, he was unwilling to pursue this option, which, 
while it is disappointing to me, I accept.

The purpose of this note is twofold.

First, I would like to thank you for making this company the great place it 
is today, and for giving me the opportunity to have a great career here.  I 
will forever look upon my nine plus years with Enron fondly.

Second, I would like to ask you as the administrator of the 1997 Long Term 
Incentive Plan to allow me to explore opportunities in the venture capital 
community without triggering non-compete provisions with regard to future 
payouts.  I very much enjoyed my brief role in venture capital, and have some 
very good contacts in that area here in New York.  Since NetWorks decided to 
cease operations in that business earlier in the year, I should not think

I were not working directly in the energy space with an Enron competitor.

He and Jeffrey will fly into Istanbul, arriving on June 24 (he asked me to 
see if you knew the name of the hotel on the Bosporus - sp?)  They would stay 
there until about the 28th or so, then the three of you would head to Nairobi 
and stay at a few places.  Jeff mentioned Mt. Kenya Safari Club and another 
place I can't even begin to spell or pronounce, but I'll figure that out 
later...

You will need to be in Kilimanjaro for the safari on July 4.  The rough 
sketch of the safari is as follows:

7/4 Arrive Kilimanjaro; overnight (O/N) at the Polo Club
7/5 Charter flight to Ngorongoro (fly over Mt. Kilimanjaro); O/N at 
Ngorongoro Crater Lodge
7/6 Ngorongoro Crater tour; O/N at Crater Lodge
7/7 Drive to Monduli GCA; O/N Monduli TGTS camp
7/8 Hiking in Monduli; O/N Monduli TGTS camp
7/9 Flight to Kirawira, western Serengeti; O/N Kirawira tented camp

This is disturbing.  I can not understand how an HR employee for an Enron 
business unit can deny access to what appears to be an Enron auditor on the 
grounds that the records being sought are confidential.  As you know Sanjay 
reports to both Ken and myself in support of EBS Asia activities as well as I 
believe McDonald for Global Assets.  Given this split accountability, and the 
fact that I do not know which business unit these records apply to, you as a 
representative of Corp should probably require that Enron be given access to 
these records as part of your audit responsibilities.  If you think it 
appropriate for me to make the request I will be happy to do so.

		 Subject: India Internal Controls Assessment & Review and Cash Controls 
Standards

India Management,

We are in the process of conducting a follow-up of the Internal Controls 
Review that was conducted last year at EIPL.  We are also conducting a 
compliance review of the Cash Controls Standards that were recently issued by 
Enron Assurance Services.  On November 3rd, we informed Milind Laad, EIPL 
Controller, and Carol Howes, Sr. Dir. Fin. & Acctg., that we would be 
conducting a visit to EIPL to perform the follow-up Internal Controls Review 
and a Cash Controls Standards audit.  An Internal Controls Review entails 
reviewing not only financial areas but other departments such as legal, IT, 
operations, etc.  

We started our testing late last week and were informed that supporting 
documentation for certain accounting transactions reside in HR.  We then 
scheduled a meeting with the head of HR, Sandip Malik, to request supporting 
documentation for the transactions and other information that is more 
relevant to HR as part of our Controls Review.   Mr. Malik denied access to 
the records on the basis that they are confidential.  Apparently, not even 
the Controller has access to some of the supporting documentation.  Mr. Malik 
stated that we needed to give him a request list, so he could clear it with 
Sanjay Bhatnagar.  We informed him that we could not give him a list but 
needed general access because we did not want to go  back and forth with 
lists given my limited time here in India and logistical difficulties in 
communicating with Mr. Bhatnager.  Mr. Bhatnager apparently was on vacation 
and now is travelling to Houston.  Given the time difference, I am requesting 
that Mr. Bhatnagar or one of the upper management executives responsible for 
India send a communication to Mr. Malik and instruct him to give me access to 
the Enron Records.  

I apologize for the inconvenience, but I had not previously experienced the 
situation where I was not given initial access to the records.  I am also 
interested in obtaining access to the payroll records for Arthur Andersen so 
they can test the project allocations developed by HR.

Home,
A sort of honor, not a building site,
Wherever we are, when, if we chose, we might,
Be somewhere else, but trust that we have chosen right.

W.H. Auden

The view from my living room, a southern view, begins with a mess of red
tiled rooftops tumbling down to the Halic (Golden Horn).  On the other side
of the Halic (a river-harbor, once beautiful and fast flowing, now stalled
and polluted) are the hills where the ancient city Byzantium (later to be
called Constantinople, later still Istanbul) was founded nearly six
centuries before the birth of Christ.  Above a cement colored smear of
apartment buildings of much more recent vintage, I can make out the outlines
of towers that were part of defensive walls first started in the 500's AD.
I can also see the massive Selimiye and Mihrimah Mosques, built in the
1500's during the reign of perhaps the greatest Ottoman, Suleyman the
Magnificent.  Otherwise, the hillsides of Eski (Old) Istanbul are covered by
the before mentioned apartment buildings, relatively new but already
appearing weary from overuse and ready for replacement.  They are, I
suppose, full of people who for the most part work far too much for far too
little and who must wonder, more and more, with each passing day, about the
relevance of their muezzins' cries.  Incongruously, hundreds, maybe
thousands, of sea gulls, screeching a bit like Halloween pranksters, dip and
rise in the air space between me and all of that.

I recently bought a cheap guitar (I left a better one back in the States)
from my friend Ilyas, and from time to time I sit looking out my window
while playing sad songs from America's south (the easiest kind to play --
slow, with three chords and, as Bono [pretentiously] said, the truth).  This
evening, I did just that, singing and playing, among others, a song by Steve
Earle, in which he laments having forgotten to say goodbye to some long ago
love (""Was I off somewhere, or maybe just too high?"") and one by Lucinda
Williams, who sings about hitting the road in order to forget (""When I get
to Baton Rouge, I won't cry a tear for you"").  A pile of clouds staacked up
on the horizon prevents me from seeing the sunset, but the invisible sun
still makes its presence know, bordering them crimson.  I watch the
neddle-like vapor trail of a jet crawl west -- until it too disappears
behind the clouds -- all the time wondering about when I too will be heading
in that same direction.

What will it be like to be in America again?  I don't think I've ever
developed particularly deep psychic connections with places, though that is
not to say I haven't loved the places I've lived.  I truly adore San
Francisco and I always come to Dallas's defense.  I appreciate Aurora
(Illinois) and miss Westfield (New Jersey), often wondering what it would
have been like to have finished my growing up there.  But because, perhaps,
I ultimately value experience more than comfort -- and, don't get me wrong,
I value comfort a great deal -- maybe I haven't been able to convince
myself, at some critical, fundamental level, to believe that settling down
in one place (or, come to think of it, with one person) for the rest of my
life is an  ultimate goal.  Of course, I worry about where this all might
lead, with the specter of absolute -- and perhaps, God forbid, unbearable --
loneliness sometimes seeming a real possibility.  But, then again, maybe I'm
just looking for the ultimate home, and will burrow in deeply once I've
found it.

My great buddy Misha and his wife Nina just returned to their home after
what was, for me at least, a wonderful ten-day visit.  They weren't so sure
about the Boza (a sweet, slightly fermented drink made from millet) I
accosted them with at a tiny caf? in the center of Eski Istanbul, but they
tried it anyway.  Later, forgetting about how scared I had been the first
time I was there, I think I spooked them a bit when I lead them on a
post-dusk walk through the ""working class"" Kucuk Pazar neighborhood (on our
way to the breathtaking interior and exterior views at the Suleymaniye
Mosque).  While passing through Kucuk Pazar, we turned into one particularly
poorly lit street and came upon a crowd of men talking and smoking in near
total darkness.  (I could only tell they were smoking by the occasional
flare of the embers at the end of their cigarettes.)  After first not
knowing what in the world we'd stumbled onto, I realized we were passing
near a hamam (Turkish public bath) -- no doubt an immensely important
institution in Kucuk Pazar, as many of the apartments there (I have been
told) have no showers.

Notwithstanding these, and a few other nonstarters, I still think Misha and
Nina's trip was a success.  We did and saw a lot, albiet while suffering
through the hot, humid beginnings of an Istanbul summer.  Probably of most
significance, to me, was checking in with Misha after nearly nine months
apart.  We had much to talk about, or at least to allude to vaguely.  During
one of our more memorable (i.e. ridiculous) jaunts into these wordy
never-never lands (which occurred on the roof porch of my building and
lasted until four in the morning), Misha was patient and courteous when I
suggested that maybe our lives are played out in the barely understood space
between an incomprehensible universe and an equally incomprehensible self.
Misha wanted to give ourselves more credit in the ability to understand
department.  In response, I referred to some of the books I've read.

This summer I will not be taking formal Turkish lessons, though I plan on
studying Turkish a lot; for example, translating newspaper articles and
writing and, with the help of Ismail and Sukran, trying to absorb more
deeply all that I have learned to date.  And I have learned a lot, including
an incredible amount of grammar and vocabulary.  Still, I wonder if this old
dog brain of mine is thinking less about the next meal than about where to
lay down afterwards.  My biggest problem -- among many, I know -- is
""hearing"" Turkish.  (My two most used sentences are ""Ne dediniz [What did
you say]?"" and ""Tekrar soyleyebilir misiniz [Can you say that again]?"".)  I
will be buying a television (ugh!), as I've concluded that a television is
an important way to learn how to ""hear"" Turkish.

Most importantly, this summer I will finally be beginning a regular writing
program, writing for a least three hours a day, five days a week.
(""Insallah [With god's help]."")  That, coupled with work and Turkish (and my
reading), should keep me pretty busy and, hopefully, productive.  At least I
should be sending a few more e-mails.

More later.

Mark-O

I am pleased to report that everyone has been working extremely hard to

find everything most interesting and exciting.  While discussing the current
situation with Awano and Seguchi we touched upon your initial reaction to
our valuation and came upon a fundamental realization.  Because we have as

with you it is not surprising that you would  be unaware of how much value
we truly believe we have in these projects.  Recognizing that Enron will
need to review and evaluate the assumptions we have utilized I still wanted

Taking the Mutsu Ogawara numbers alone and discounting them to a financial
closing date at the end of 2003 (utilizing a 15% discount rate) results in a
Net Present Value of US$848 million. In other words, if we were to flip this
project at financial close it would be worth at least this much.  Using a
discount rate of 10%, still considered very high for a Japanese investment
return and likely attractive to many Japanese investors, the value is in
excess of US$1.5 billion.  Looked at another way, discounting the NPV back
to 2001 at 15% results in a current NPV of $558 million, or more than $34
per current EnCom share!  Assess any reasonable probability factor -50% or
33% - and you still get $11 to $17 share.  Our assumptions were developed
conservatively and are quite defensible.  As an example of our conservatism,
we incorporated 300 MW of simple cycle combustion turbines into the Mutsu
Ogawara Project capital costs to provide peaking or backup capacity and yet
included zero revenues from this capacity.  Therefore any value attributable
to this additional 300 MW represents pure upside.  This also includes zero
upside from any marketing of natural gas into this gas deficient part of
northern Japan.  These numbers may be hard to believe but we are comfortable
that your due diligence will bear them out.

More exciting is the fact that the Ube economics are even better.  Looking
at just these two projects and placing a ridiculously low 20% probability of
success on them together with the $3 per share of cash on our balance sheet
gives you nearly $20 per share current value.  This is without considering
Oita or any of the other many projects we are currently working on. This is
why I was surprised by your reaction to our valuation.  If Enron, with all
of its significant resources and experience, were to fully support EnCom on
these two projects we believe that the probability of their success would be
quite high. (We have been receiving excellent support from the Global LNG
Group by the way) This is also why I would suggest that we focus our
immediate attention on these two projects together with perhaps the Oita LNG
Project.  It will prevent your team from becoming stretched too thin and may
accelerate your ability to come to a conclusion with respect to valuation.
I think that we would agree that reaching a conclusion as quick as possible
is in all shareholders interests.

My main concern continues to be that the current infighting between Enron
Japan and E Power has limited Enron's ability to recognize 1) the quality
and significant capabilities of the employees of E Power and 2) the
significant value that has been created through the nearly 2 years of
systematic and comparative analysis of all of the potential greenfield sites
in Japan as well as the significant progress with respect to brownfield
developments.   I am hopeful that your due diligence team will quickly come
to understand this.  Within the next six months we expect to be able to take
off of the market nearly three quarters of the most attractive development
sites in Japan leaving little for the late comers to the Japanese market.
We continue to hope that together we can find a way to focus our mutual
energies on building value in this exciting market rather than on
non-productive bickering and turf wars.

She said she had tapped into the following for potential candidates:
1. Ad placed in Fire Chief Magazine and on Firechief.com web page.
2. Announcement sent to all HFD employees.
3. Utilized Municipal Yellow pages (a who's who in the leading city and 
county governments and local authorities), targeting fire department 
personnel in the top 18 cities (based on population).

As a result of her efforts, 18 resumes have been received and were forwarded 
to me. However, when I accessed the firechief.com web page this weekend I 
could not find the advertisement (I have asked her to check on this ASAP). 
Moreover, surfing various web pages/sites related to fire 
departments/associations, I was very impressed by the International Fire 
Chiefs web page (especially compared to the Fire Chief web page) and 
suggested to Jan as well as Dennis Thompson (see below) that we try to 
advertise there as well.

As a result of my ""surfing the net"", I have compiled a list of decorated fire 
chiefs as well as recognized fire chief leaders on various fire related 
boards and committees. While these individuals may not fit into the top 18 
cities in terms of population, I do not believe we should narrow our search 
to this criteria. I believe what we are looking for here is an outstanding 
leader with a track record of implementing change and cooperation within the 
different divisions in the fire department. 

Dennis Thompson, Special Projects Director, Public Safety & Drug Policy. I 
met with him today at 11am. He expects to have an answer on the legal issue 
(whether I would be excluded from public access) sometime today and the list 
of HFD and consultant contacts possibly today but most likely tomorrow. 

Of special interest from our discussions are the following:

1. Internal vs. external issue 
- only one Fire Chief was from outside (Swartout) and it was a disaster (he 
lasted 3 1/2 months)
- Acting Fire Chief, Connealy, really wants the job

2. Current state of the fire department
- fire prevention (considered critical by TriData) wasn't given the attention 
needed by Tyra
- personnel fractioned - union partly to blame
- communication broken down
- low moral
- department underfunded

Please let me know if I am overlooking anything here.

Jeff,

We spent quite a bit of time over the past several months discussing a 
possible minority investment of about $5MM in Silicon Energy.  We have broken 
off those discussions because (1) their proposed pre-money valuation of 
$150MM was, in our opinion, excessive, and (2) our people at EES, who would 
be the primary users of Silicon Energy, were not happy with Silicon Energy's 
functionality.

With this in mind, have you had discussions with John which we should know 
about or which would help give us strategic direction?

Thanks,
Kevin W. Kuykendall

Sounds like everything's still on track for you, which is excellent.? We 
have not done anything with Tridium.? As for their management issues, as 
with any small company they have some holes they need to fill. 
Nevertheless, we're pretty comfortable with their overall team. 

Good luck with your continued progress.? I definitely look forward to 
receiving occasional updates.? We still may have reason to join up in the 
future.

Kevin - we will be releasing the names of the primary investors in our 
Series D round in a press release shortly and will make sure it gets to 
you.? We are talking to a few banks and are still on track for a 4 
(superscript: th) quarter IPO, although they are trying to get us to 
register sooner.? The Carrier partnership is fantastic - we already have a 
few new customers on the utility side for the residential curtailment

Tridium?? Have they solved their management issues??? JW

In the March 2001 article of ecompany you recently made a statement about
what "" Keep's

dread the chance
the system will crash.  We had an air-conditioning problem last April or
May, and we went down.

gas trading stops because
EnronOnline is down.'

?
Hope Mom and Sue's trip to Florida went well, and that there were no problems 
with things like getting the correct change, etc.? I've heard that there is 
a?counting problem down there, with everyone using?different standards and 
then being stopped from doing the counting altogether.? Makes a lot 
of?trouble if all you want is a six-pack (of pop, that is) to go!
?
And Tom and Jeff's time in DC?
?
About the excess symbols that you all are getting in my email; Hotmail (i.e. 
Microsoft) recently added a more sophisitcated ""Microsoft Word""-like program, 
and I suspect that Dad's computer needs a special program to filter out all 
the ""infra-structure"" stuff.? And guess what, (I suspect) Microsoft sells 
such a program.
?
All goes well.? Its cold here, but nothing like Chicago.? For example, it 
will go below freezing at night occasionally, hovering around the low forties 
mid-day.? Little wetness this year, which a problem given ?a shortage of 
electricity and the low water levels in the hydroelectric system.??
?
My boss turning out to be a?bit of a egomaniac.? He fired three people, in a 
huff about some little thing, over the phone on Friday (two support staff, 
one lawyer).??The lawyer, admittedly, was a joke, the?others?no great shakes 
(though, they were?as good as we've got).??The manner of their demise, 
however,?was inappropriate.??I could tell you more.? For example, I 
often?suggest that we hire more experienced lawyers, expecially given the 
stuff he has me saying in our promo materials (and the prices we charge).? He 
demures, saying that experienced attorneys have ""bad habits"" (like, perhaps, 
experience?; and I guess he would thus include me amongst those with ""bad 
habits"").? I suspect the real reason he feels this way is?that he doesn't 
want to be second guessed.? Still (though I am starting to second guess him 
more and more) he treats me well, all in all.? (One particularly ann! oying 
thing is that he?likes to remind me how the ""Americans"" are giving lots of 
money to the Islamic fundamentalists here and doing many other things to keep 
Turkey weak, for?the most part extreme, absurd claims.)? I will at least stay 
on for the experience and the material?(I could write a book about the guy, 
though few would believe it), and to be?able to continue work on Spot On.
?
More later.? Sorry for the ragging session, but we all need one from time to 
time.? Right? 
?
Write often!

Subject: University of Texas conference on energy finance, February 2001

Jeff,

Our friends at the University of Texas are planning a conference on energy
economics and finance in February of next year. They would like very much to 
have 
you as a keynote speaker. 

Given our good, long-term  relationship with UT,  I would recommend
that you speak at this conference. I talked to Prof. Ehud Ronn
a few times about the program and  I think that this will be 
an excellent forum to present Enron's accomplishments and
agenda for the future.

I am sure that Rick Causey will join me in making the same recommendation.

Vince

Macedonia surprisingly impressive; green valleys tucked in between

I had read (at least as this all appeared from the window of the plane).? We 
happened to arrive at the same time Secretary of State Colin Powell; the

into town lined with KFOR (from Kosovo, just 30 km away) soldiers and local 
police; we got delayed for 20 minutes or so as Powell's motorcade?passed, 
reminding me of a time when I was stuck in a similar traffic jam in Chicago 
caused by the passing of father Bush.? While there we met with a pimply-faced 
Minister of Transportation and?made little progress in our negotiations as 
deal breaking ""collateral"" issue came up;?I had a nice evening stoll through 
the old ruins of an Ottoman fort and dropped in on an Eastern Orthodox church 
ceremony (which I found beautiful though a b! it creepy, as the worshipping 
spaces in their churches are small, crowded with the pious and?made to seem 
further cramped by the smoke of incense?and walls completely covered with 
icons).? Heard no gun fire or bomb blasts from the nearby hills, where 
recently some Albanian rebels complaining of an absence of political adn 
economic rights had been trying to mess things up a bit.? I was told by 
local, non-Albanians, that the trouble had been exaggerated by the western 
press.? All very interesting.? Details will be in the book!

AT&T:  David Dorman,  President of AT&T (bio points below)

Enron:  Jeff Skilling, Stewart Seeligson, David Cox

Adventis: Partha Ghosh, Andy Belt and Mark Bruneau (via telephone)


Background:

As you well know, over the last 9 months EBS has made substantial efforts to 
establish a significant commercial relationship with AT&T.  Thus far, there 
have been no transactions between EBS and AT&T other than a couple dozen of 
circuit purchases by us mostly local loop.  Previously, our primary senior 
point of contact with AT&T has been Frank Ianna (President of Network 
Services).  It is probable that Ianna brought only the typical legacy 
perspective which prevented him from seeing how we could facilitate the AT&T 
business from a wholesale relationship.  They seemed to only want to sell us 
services.

Adventis advises us that Ianna now reports to David Dorman and that Dorman 
should be able to better understand the value that EBS can bring to further 
his business objectives.  It is my understanding that it will only be Dorman 
at the meeting (he is supposedly not bringing Ianna).  I view this meeting as 
a worthwhile shot to see if it is worth pursuing AT&T at all for the balance 
of the year for a big transaction.  Dorman's positive receptability to us is 
the only reason I can see to spend significant resources on AT&T in the near 
future.


EBS - AT&T History

Jun 2000 EES sponsored Executive Briefing with focus on EES and EBS - 
attendants include Frank Ianna from AT&T.

Oct 2000 - Extensive EBS team meets with extensive AT&T team to set up eight 
tactical and strategic working teams to find opportunities for the   
companies to build a bilateral commercial relationship.  After three weeks, 
results were presented to executive committee of both teams. Nothing 
materializes.

Potential Opportunities

AT&T currently spends a significant amount each year (expected to be in the 
$100s of millions) on offnet services (wholesale expenses) .  EBS would like 
AT&T to allocate a potion of the purchases towards EBS.

Adventis states there are currently numerous major undertakings by AT&T which 
are transforming the telecommunications operations at AT&T.  Is there not 
something EBS could do to help advance these undertakings?

At a minimum we would like AT&T to interconnect to our pooling points.


Final Note

I do not think we should lead with trading.  We should lead with our ability 
to provide services to the wholesale sector of the industry. The typical 
reaction we get from incumbent players is that if they don't trade or if they 
think that trading puts downward pressure on prices, then they should not do 
business with Enron.  They need to understand that they don't need to trade 
to have a valuable business relationship with  Enron

Jeff,

I spoke with Mark Palmer concerning the interview with Businessweek magazine, 
January 2nd.  He has asked me to participate in the article to discuss Enron 
Media Services and thought it would be a good idea for me  to give you a 
quick update in the event the reporter questions you about the business.  Let 
me know if you would like for me to stop by or call you to bring you up to 
date.   I will be out on vacation December 20th returning January 2nd.

Congratulations on your appointment to CEO.

Hi Stan:

It was good to meet you this morning. I've enjoyed working out with Joel;
he's a good ""kid"" and I can certainly relate to his Midwest roots and Iowa
State background. I grew up on a grain/livestock farm in Gladbrook, Iowa, a
town of under 1,000 people, and did my BS at Iowa State and MBA at Kansas
University.

I'm currently working as Director, Business Development at RedMeteor.com,
an
internet-based energy brokerage company. We compete against Altra Energy,
EnronOnline, InterContinentalExchange and HoustonStreet. We started with
$22
million in venture capital, but need an additional infusion of capital to
build out our business model. I think it's going to be difficult for us to
attract additional funding in this climate, so I'm interested in making a
move to another employer when I find the right fit.

As I mentioned this morning, I've been talking with Conoco recently (my
previous employer for 9 years) as well as Enron's Broadband Services group.
I'm looking for a Houston-based business development position that would
build on my eCommerce experience at RedMeteor or my oil & gas pipeline
operations background. I've also met with Reliant Energy recently although
I
understand they've suspended hiring in their trading/eCommerce groups due
to
the California crisis.

Any suggestions you would have would be appreciated. Thanks for your time.

Dear Dorothy:

Thank you very much for your note; below I have laid out the agenda for the
meeting for Ken and Jeff's approval:

1. Introduction to Adventis and our work in the Broad band space; - 20 minutes
2.  Ken's brief on Broad Band Services group's way forward: challenges,
issues, aspirations; - 15 minutes
3. Jeff's expectations and views form the corporate center;-10 minutes
4. Adventis' approach, likely routes to partnership;-10 minutes
5. Next steps: JEFF, KEN and our team.- 10/15 minutes

During the second hour with Ken, we wish to address specific points on the
out come of the first meeting to define areas of focus for path forward:

1 Strategic and operational issues for short term value creation, and
long-term robust development of BBS as global player
2. Acceleration capacity at BBS to capture short range opportunities versus
outside assistance.
3. Likely ways we could engage with Enron for both short term and long-term
wins.
4. Time line for creating the upside.

I am sure Ken and Jeff, will have a lot to add. Please do let me know.

Dorothy, given the significant challenges and opportunities ahead for Enron
BBS, we will have four of our senior most partners with deep insights into
Broad band and ASPs/CSPs join the meeting. I will come the night before, if
possible to have dinner with Jeff and/or Ken. Please do let me know the
possibility.

Regards,

Partha Ghosh

Earlier, with some trepidation, I turned on my laptop, opened up Word
(Microsoft's word processing program) and, once there, my journal.  I typed
in ""January"".  Before I could go on, however, Mr. Gates' program proudly
displayed the fact it knew where I was going, anticipating a date.  The
program guessed the date would be ""January 1, 2000"".  It was right.  I
smiled to myself at what seemed, at the moment, a bit of bravado.  I was
also pleased that I had apparently been left unbitten by the dreaded Y2K
bug, as had (I understood from the news reports) most of the rest of the
world.

I am happily settling down to a quiet Saturday night alone, after a
(slightly) booze-soaked Friday night of saying a great big ""hey"" to the new
millenium.  Last night my girlfriend Sukran and I had gone to my friend
Ismail's, joining his family and a dozen or so of his friends.  We drank
wine and raki (the Turkish version of the anise-based liquor that is
reported to have helped kill, among others, Turkey's founding father Mustafa
Kemal Ataturk).  We listened to and sang (here, I have to admit, I was still
mostly listening) Turkish songs, as well as a few by Bob Dylan (with me
privately concluding that ""Blowing in the Wind"", after hearing it again
after so many years, was the song of the century).

Closer to midnight we turned on the television, watched the view from the
air of Istanbul's magnificent Blue Mosque, set ablaze by its powerful
floodlights.  A smallish crowd, reported to be about 1,000, would later
watch a modest fireworks display there.  The TV switched to another aerial
view, this time of Istanbul's Taksim Square.  Though the square can fairly
described as Istanbul's Times Square, the crowd there, which I later learned
was overwhelmingly male, could not have numbered more than a few tens of
thousands.  At midnight the TV was shut off and we gathered around Ismail's
seventh floor windows.  From there we watched his neighbors, apparently
observing an age-old New Year's tradition in his neighborhood (Kurtulus),
dropped empty bottles from their windows into the street below.  The roof of
a Mercedes was dented.  Taxies wove their way between exploded bottles,
which on the pavement below -- from my somewhat alcohol-laced, seven-story
high perspective -- looked like giant snowflakes.  People hung from windows
along both sides of the street, some waving sparklers and shouting.  Passing
cars, ignoring the threat from above, tooted their horns merrily.  In the
distance was the sound of fireworks coming from Taksim and the sky, already
hazy from the ubiquitous smog, became spotted with clouds of drifting
gunpowder smoke.

As the night went on (and delightfully on) I learned that every one of the
couples at Ismail's, including Sukran and me, had had a serious fight
earlier in what was now the previous day.  I was surprised by this and
wondered (without reaching any conclusions) what it might have been about
the day that triggered such behavior.  Yet despite the troubling things
inspired by the final few moments of the last particularly wonderful and
terrible century, all were forgotten in the first few moments of the next
(and still undescribable) one -- replaced for the time being by smiles,
songs and much laughter.

And indeed it appears the night passed in a similarly positive fashion
worldwide.  Threats here in Turkey of attacks on millenium celebrations by
Islamic radicals -- apparently offended by both the booze and the brouhaha
over the passing of a date on the Christian calendar -- proved empty (or
perhaps frustrated by the conspicuous number of police).  Nothing else of
that kind, or of any other kind of awfulness, appeared to have occurred
anywhere in the world.  Even the Y2K bug seems to have been born without a
stinger.  What a nice way to start the new year/decade/century/millenium.

Once again good to hear from you.  Still no electricity or water, though
again luckily lap top battery working.  I am also surprised able to get on
line and get through.  Once electricity goes back on will probably have a
tougher time getting trhough.  A bit ironic.

Took a long walk around this morning, crossing the Galata Bridge into Old
Istanbul (my neighborhood can't be called young) and saw little evidence of
damage.  Suspect most of it in new construction areas out on the edge of
this huge metropolitan area, where conrers get cut.  This is a poor country
with a lot of folks struggling just to put the flimsiest of roofs over their
head.

Knock on wood, but think you can all rest easy.  Doesn't seem to be any fire
risk nearby, etc.  Your right about nighttime timing; was on the darkened
deck of a ship in a mighty stormy sea.  CNN says 7.8 or somthing in Izmit
(65 miles east of here)!  I'm on the top floor and had all kinds of images
going through my head, as you can imagine.

More later.  Love you too and looking forward to seeing you in October.

Joannie,

Just a reminder about the job tour on Wednesday.  I will be in San Diego
until Tuesday night so I wanted to check in today.  I will be happy to come
to Jeff's office to pick him up or we can meet in the lobby. Just give me a
time and I'll set it up.  I will also be available to show him the Hobby
Performing Arts Center if he has time.

The Leadership Circle has become a highlight of our annual conference, 
bringing together a very high-level, select group of government ministers and 
energy decision makers for informal discussions as well as substantive 
presentations on issues of common concern.

Our focus this year is energy market turmoil and its effect on investment 
strategies, regulatory backlash, and industry structure.? We will also 
discuss the postelection prospects for the economy and US politics. Note that 
we have extended the program in response to member suggestions and have 
included recreational activities on Sunday, February 11, and a reception that 
evening at the unique Paraiso Maravilla in Houston, as well as a special 
Summit on Energy Supply and Investment on Monday morning.

To view the complete program, and for details on sponsorship and 
registration, please visit our web site at 
http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/mc.cfm?p=674&c=22418. Please reserve your place

meantime, should you have any questions regarding Leadership Circle 
participation or sponsorship, please contact Sabrina Wisner, Leadership 
Circle Manager, at +1 617 441 1339 or swisner@cera.com.

presenters.  Apparently, Jeff's recollection that Matt was to contact the 
presenters was inaccurate; Matt indicated that it had been agreed that you 
would contact the presenters and he would be responsible for arranging the 
SUN demonstration.  

With Jeff out of town until Monday, I would really like to have someone 
contact the presenters before the end of the week.  Is this going to be 
possible?  I'll call you tomorrow to follow up.  In the meantime, below are 
the links to the presenters' bios, which I believe include their phone 
numbers.  Let me know if you have any trouble launching any of them.  

Additionally, I spoke to Penny this morning regarding the number of RSVPs we 
have to date.  I'm very concerned about space and would like you guys to 
reconsider the buffet idea, with seating scattered around the facility, and 
the meeting room set up ""class room"" style.  If we go with the plated 
breakfast and have 120 people seated around 12 ""10-tops,"" there will be no 
space for a screen, podium, AV equipment, etc.  If we have more than 120 
people (I think the number this morning was 104 with reservations continuing 
to come in), we will not have enough space to seat everyone in the meeting 
room.  In talking with some of the others who have planned breakfasts for the 
YPO group, I've been told that many YPOers do not show for the breakfast and 
will walk in just in time for the presentations.  I think you guys and Jeff 
are scheduled to meet next Tuesday, so perhaps that can be discussed then.

I'll give you a call tomorrow, Mike.  Thanks, SRS

Got mom's letter last week; and it only took about a week to get here.
Thanks.  Enjoyed the pictures of Tom.

Mom, you're right about a place to live.  Have a good one here.  A bit
raw by US standards, but perfect for me.  Older building in interesting,
""real"" neighborhood; aesthetically pleasing apartment, with wood floors,
ok molding, and super excellent, quintessential Istanbul view.  There
are twelve apartments in the building, most of which are rented by
Moslem families (veils and all).  A couple are used for storage by local
businesses and one is rented by an English journalist.  Will get some
pictures to you someday soon (though not taking many photos so far, as
want to experience this place as much in my brain, where the words are,
as is possible).  Took a while to get my place reasonably comfortable,
as had to buy furniture, etc, but that actually a lot of fun, in a way.
Part of the experience, and I learned a lot.  Even had to install my own
light fixtures.  No central-heating, so use one natural gas and one
electric heater.  Ismail was/is very helpful in all ways, both with
technical support and with help finding bargains.  I've been very lucky.

Not ""running"" around too much.  Indeed, literally can't run.  Otherwise,
my new hips performing flawlessly and thrilled at the absence of pain
and how strong they are.  Hoping to find an affordable pool around here,
but such things not high on Turkey's needed infrastructure list.  Except
for super expensive pools in the luxury hotels ($25/day), very few pools
in Istanbul.  (Sorry Dad, no golf courses either.)

Haven't worked too hard on trying to paint the ""big picture"" in my
little blurbs.  But generally, go to Turkish classes three mornings a
week, starting at nine o'clock, for four hours each day.  Study a least
that much on my own, not including trying to have ""real life"" Turkish
lessons.  Work about 15 hours a week, not including preparation and
travelling time, which almost doubles that figure.  (Since each work
session usually only two hours, spend an inordinate amount of time on
unpaid travelling; so far that's ok, as I enjoy the travelling, because
I get to see odd parts of Istanbul.  That bit of charm will probably
wear off over time.)  Have enjoyed figuring out the transit system, and
have gotten pretty good at using the buses, metro, the dolmas (something
in between buses and taxis).  Cook at home a few times a week -- pasta,
rice and veggies; things like that (there are tiny bakeries and
vegitable stands everywhere)  -- though eating out here can be really
cheap and interesting.  Have two really good Turk friends now; Ismail
and a wonderful women named Sukran (pronounced ""Shookrahn"").  Spend very
little time with yabanci (foreigners, like me).  We spend a fair amount
of time in cafes (which are bountiful and central to life her) talking
about writing, politics, Turkish, etc.  At least once a week I go on a
long walk through a part of the city I haven't seen yet.  Ismial usually
joins me.  These are always amazing and are probably the most important
part of my life here.  There's a Turkish newspaper that's written in
English, which I try to read most days.  Most days I also visit New York
Times and CNN web cites.  As you can see, taking this all very
seriously, am very busy and am loving every minute of it.

More later.  Working on a blurb about a strange religious holiday we're
in the midst of right now.

Thanks for your interest, which as I've mentioned before important for
me.  And, especially, thanks for keeping in touch.

Love,

Mark

It would be helpful if Jeff could give me a sound bite to headline his 
discussion for the group.  One obvious area of interest is how Enron has 
transformed itself over the last ten years to the P/E ratio of 50+ we see 
today.  Another area of interest would be Enron's perspective of free 
markets, regulators and California.  Please let me know Jeff's preference.

Subject: UK CEOs

Jeff,

As you may recall from our discussion on your visit to London last summer, 
one of the challenges we have in Europe is raising the external profile of 
Enron.  To help address this, I recently replaced Ralph in a group of UK CEOs 
which meet monthly, so I can continue to raise awareness of Enron's 
businesses and generally network.   At each lunch meeting which lasts around 
two hours, one of the CEOs makes an informal 20 minute speech on a current 
business subject of their choice and then a discussion follows.

The group has asked if you would like to chair the meeting in September 2001 
on a date of your choice.  At the end of this note there is a list of the 
current membership.  I have been to one meeting and only around a third 
attended.

Please let me know if you are able to commit time to this.  There is no 
problem if you decline.

Matthew

Several months ago, you agreed to participate in an interview about problem
solving for a book I am writing to be published later this year.  The
manuscript is rapidly coming to completion, and I want to take this
opportunity to make contact for several reasons.

First, I've enclosed a draft of the chapter that covers you.  If you or an
assistant have time to read this, make a check for factual errors and let
me know your reaction within two weeks of this letter's date, I would very
much appreciate it.  The production schedule at this point is strict, and
unfortunately, our miscommunication about your change in email address
hasn't left us much time.  End of this week will be OK though.  If you have
any additional insights you feel should be added, or important things I've
missed, please include those as well.  Any comments can be emailed to me at
chrishoenig@exolve.com.

Second, thank you so much for your time and the kind assistance of your
staff, in helping to make this project work.  I believe you will find the
final product of some interest, and I will make sure that you get a free
copy upon publication.

Third, In return for sharing your insights, I'd like to offer you the only
compensation I can at this time, which is to share knowledge in return.  If
there is one organization - for example, the leadership team of a local
charity, a citizen's group - that you would like to receive a briefing or
hear a speech on this subject, I would be pleased to contribute.

Fourth, I am currently in the process of founding a non-profit organization
that will be dedicated to gathering knowledge on problem solving to create
a public trust that can be a resource for educators around the world.  Just
as other conservation organizations identify and protect land, historical
treasures or other assets, in the knowledge age, I believe that the core
high quality knowledge on how human beings solve problems should also be
conserved, protected and made widely available throughout educational
systems.  If this project interests you and you would like more information
or to lend your support, we would welcome your involvement.

Most Sincerely,


Christopher Hoenig

My prayers were answered.  I am proud to be a part of this team and look 
forward to many years of prosperity and success.  After working for a private 
practice for 10 years and being told that the corporate work environment was 
impersonal, I have seen ENRON promote and display respect, integrity, 
communication and excellence.  If someone gives respect, the person receiving 
it might build up their self-esteem and in return respect others.  Being 
honest gains trust and sometimes trust can be more valuable than money.  
Without communication, walls are built and eventually tumble down hurting 
everyone/everything surrounding them.  I really applaud your vision on 
communication.  Good communication is the main ingredient in every view of 
life.  Keep up the good work.  Striving for excellence encourages people to 
work hard, utilize their creative minds, explore new areas, and learn to 
adjust to change.

Dear Neil,

If you can come to ours, it would be greatly appreciated.  We're located at
1400 Smith Street, Suite 5007.  You can park in the Allen Center Garage
visitor parking (entrances off of Clay and Andrews Streets), which is
connected to our building by a skywalk on the 3rd floor.  You'll have to
check in with security in the lobby of our building, but I'll let them know
you and Paul are expected so as to expedite the process.  Will anyone else
be accompanying you?  Please advise.  Thank you.

didn't get a chance to talk.  Paul and I would appreciate the opportunity
to
set up a meeting before the holidays.  I know it's going to be tough given

Subject:  Genesis Park


Jeff, I've been meaning to corner you at one of the YPO functions to spend
a
minute discussing a couple of topics.  First and foremost, I wanted to
introduce Genesis Park which is a ""new economy"" investment company that's
been recently founded here in Houston by Paul Hobby, Fred Lummis, Steve
Gibson, Peter Shaper, Bruce Herzog and myself.  Paul and I were hoping to
have an opportunity to spend 30 minutes with you in the next few weeks to
describe in person what we're all about.  And to be clear, we're not
looking
for Enron money, we are raising money from private individuals.  We've
already met with Jay Fitzgerald and Steve Horn to establish the
Enron/Genesis business relationship.

I also wanted to get your views on Enron's approach to oil trading and
whether the Vitol Group presented an opportunity.  Frankly, I think Vitol
is
an excellent acquisition target although the success they've enjoyed in the
last year or two will make it a bit more difficult.  They have an
unbelievable franchise, but they also have some fundamental weaknesses
which
could be exploited to Enron's benefit.  I'm shooting in the dark here but
hopefully it's worth some discussion.

If you can free some time during this busy holiday period to meet, it would
be greatly appreciated.  Paul and I could come to your office, or possibly
you could come to our ""offices"" over on Hermann Park.  We're buying 17
acres
on Hermann Park adjacent to the Park Lane Towers which we plan to develop
into a technology park.  For the time being, we are officing in a high tech
shed on the property!

Please let me know.  Thanks/Neil.

Subject: RISK AWARDS PRESENTATION





I am sure you are aware that as part of  first ever Risk Awards - published 
in January - Enron Corporation achieved the  accolade: Energy/commodity 
derivatives house of the  year.

This award was won, not simply  because of your lead in energy and power in 
the US, but because of the lead  Enron has taken in new areas of risk 
management.

We very much hope you can join us to be presented  with the Award at the Risk 
2000 Europe Congress in Paris on April 11th - we  invite you to attend the 
conference as a full delegate and I am sure there are a  number of sessions 
which will be of interest to you. A formal invitation will  follow from our 
editor.

We also intend to publish a special  supplement that will provide Awards 
winners with an excellent opportunity to  celebrate their achievements 
through advertising.

This supplement will be distributed with the  March issue of Risk and to all 
delegates attending the Risk 2000  Congress.




For more details on the  Risk 2000 congress please click this link: 
http://www.riskpublications.com/risk2000euro/index.htm
 

I hope that my email is clear and I will  contact you shortly to find-out 
your reactions to our proposal - however if you  have any questions 
beforehand - please feel free to contact  me.

My experience at both companies has been wonderful, fruitful and exciting.

getting sort of messy in the picture folder.  We still have lots of
storage space and since many of the brothers are still getting their
first view of eWooglin.com I think we should keep all the pics. They
are listed in alphabetical order in the folders.

I took the liberty of moving all the pictures into folders. So just
post any new pictures in the top level folder ""Pictures"" and you can
find all the others in the lower level folders entitled ""golf""
or ""football game"" etc. If you want to post the pictures directly to
a sub-folder, that's perfectly OK too, because the email notice that
is automatically sent when you upload a picture file will send us all
the right place. But casual browsers looking for new pictures may not
think to look into the sub-folders.

To navigate back out of a lower level folder just click on the
word ""Files"" in the left hand column. That puts you at the top of the
folder directory and you can then click on ""Pictures"" again.  That
puts you back to the newest pictures and all the other picture files.
Sorry if this slows down getting to around to all the files. Looking
at the pics by staying within one folder is still the fastest way to
see all of them.

I'm sure if you don't like this solution, you'll let me know. There
are no shy Betas.

Thanks for all the great pictures and commentary. It's a joy to see
your stuff when I take a break at work from trying to ""Enable the
Information Age [tm].""

 1. Nine Classes To Celebrate Reunions At Homecoming October 26-29
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Graduates of the classes of 1955, '60, '65, '70, '75, '80, '85, '90, and
'95 will celebrate reunions during this year's Homecoming weekend, October
26-29. Reunion alumni have several opportunities to participate in events
especially for them, including parties on The Boulevard before and after
the SMU-Nevada game and special club-level tours of the Gerald J. Ford
Stadium and Paul B. Loyd Jr. All-Sports Complex.

Activities for all members of the SMU community include performances,
panel discussions, the 2000 Distinguished Alumni Awards celebration,
Homecoming luncheon, open houses in SMU's schools and libraries, campus
tours, the ""Pigskin Revue"" dinner, the All-School Gathering, and the
lighted Homecoming Parade, featuring grand marshals and Pro Football Hall
of Fame members Raymond Berry ('55) and Lamar Hunt ('56).

 2. Beta's '75 Planning ""Mother of All Homecomings""
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 25th reunion of those hilarious Beta boys appears to be not only in full

swing, thanks to the efforts of lead organizer Fred ""Beek"" Haulenbeek of
Vermont, but an event for the ages.  Just of few of the planned activities
for the weekend include:  A return trip to Mineola in a Ryder truck,
complete with an Officer Caffey-led SMU security escort.  A re-enactment at
somebody's house named Elvis (believed to be Wayne Thompson) of something
called a dork, or dorg, or whatever, complete with a liver and onions dinner

served up by several canines in the neighborhood.  The first presentation of

what Beta's hope to be an annual tradition, the election of the Ellen Parker

Memorial Award, which will be given to the D.O.D. (whatever that is) present

at Graceland who passes out on the commode while the party is in full
progress, then defecates into one of the alum's blankets while being driven
over to the Zeta House.  And last but certainly not least, something called
a GIANT BETA BU-FU, which will involve only the male members of the
gathering, preferably in a bottom bunk in old room #4 of the Beta House.
Also being honored at the homecoming festivities will be this year's
inductees into the Beta Hall of Shame, led by 2000's newest members, Jim
Wicklund, Rick East, Hunter Armistead, and Doug Denham.  Sounds like a blast

to all of us here at the SMU Alumni Center--you don't want to miss it.

3. Meadows Kicks Off Year-Long Celebration Of Spanish Art and Culture
------------------------------------------------------------------------

SMU's Meadows School of the Arts is celebrating the March 2001 opening of
the new Meadows Museum with ""Bridging Cultures: A Year of Spanish Art and
Tradition at SMU."" The series of events, many of them free and open to the
public, will entertain and educate on the culture, traditions, and history
of Spain through lectures, performances, screenings, and
exhibitions. Located on the SMU campus, the Meadows Museum houses one of
the finest collections of Spanish art outside of Spain.

Upcoming events for October include the Meadows Festival of Spanish Film,
featuring screenings of films by Imanol Uribe, Victor Erice, Jose Luis
Guerin, and Carlos Saura, October 11-14 in the Bob Hope Theatre; and ""The
Stars at Night...The Mystery of Santiago de Compostela,"" an art history
lecture by John Williams of the University of Pittsburgh, October 26 at 5
p.m., Room B600, Owen Arts Center.

Events for Meadows Museum members include ""Images of the Spanish Civil
War,"" a lecture by James K. Hopkins, professor of history in SMU's Dedman
College of Humanities and Sciences, October 10, 7:30 p.m., in the old
Meadows Museum, Owen Arts Center. For information on becoming a Museum
member, call 214-768-4153.

 4. Susan Faludi To Deliver Louise Raggio Lecture October 11
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Writer Susan Faludi will deliver the Louise Ballerstedt Raggio Endowed
Lecture in Women's Studies on Wednesday, October 11, at 8 p.m. in the
Hughes-Trigg Student Center. Faludi is a Pulitzer Prize-winning
journalist, winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award, and the
best-selling author of ""Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American
Women"" and ""Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Male.""

The Raggio Lecture Series brings role models of vision and achievement to
SMU to speak on gender and women's issues. Launched in 1998, the lecture
series honors Louise Raggio -- the only female in the SMU law class of
1952, the first woman assistant district attorney in Dallas, the first
woman director of the State Bar of Texas and chair of the board of the
Texas Bar Foundation, and chair of the Family Law Section of the Texas Bar
and the American Bar.

Tickets are free for SMU students, faculty, and staff, and $10 for the
general public. For more information, call 214-768-2610.


 4. SMU Establishes Company To Develop New Pharmaceutical Products
------------------------------------------------------------------------

SMU, in partnership with Research Corporation Technologies, has
established a new company to create pharmaceutical compounds based on the
work of John Buynak, associate professor of chemistry in SMU's Dedman
College of Humanities and Sciences. The company, called AlamX, is the
first such company SMU has established. Buynak has spent more than a
decade developing compounds to help fight antibiotic-resistant bacteria,
an increasing problem due to indiscriminate use of antibiotics, increases
in resistant strains of bacteria, and lack of comprehensive infection
control in many hospitals.

Christopher Martin of Research Corporation Technologies will serve as
manager of AlamX. Martin says AlamX will select several of Buynak's
compounds, match them with existing antibiotics, and screen these
combinations against a panel of resistant microorganisms. According to the
Centers for Disease Control, an estimated 500 million acute infections in
the United States require antibiotic treatment each year. In 1998, the
market for anti-infective drugs was more than $14 billion. Martin
estimates that a product effective against several classes of compounds
known to promote bacterial resistance to antibiotics could generate annual
sales in excess of $1 billion worldwide.

 5. Legal Clinic Students Win Federal Civil Rights Case
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In a case tried by students from the SMU School of Law's Legal Clinic, a
paraplegic has won a federal lawsuit against Dallas County for injuries he
suffered in the county jail infirmary. The complex civil rights case marks
a significant victory for the SMU School of Law's 50-year-old Civil
Clinic. Supervised by Professor Maureen Armour, associate dean for
clinical education and co-director of the Civil Clinic, more than 20
students, working in groups over 10 school terms, represented 41-year-old
Brent Lawson. Armour, who also teaches civil rights legislation, says that
although civil rights cases against local governments are not that
unusual, ""it's extremely difficult to win one.""

While in the Dallas County Lew Sterrett Justice Center in the fall of
1993, Lawson developed decubitus ulcers, a potentially life-threatening
condition caused by unrelieved pressure on the body. He was admitted to
the jail pending a parole revocation hearing. U.S. District Judge Jerry
Buchmeyer ruled that Lawson, who is confined to a wheelchair, should not
have been admitted to the jail because it lacked proper medical staff and
equipment to attend to his special needs. Judge Buchmeyer ruled August 30
in a 40-page opinion that the jail acted ""with deliberate indifference"" to
Lawson's constitutional rights to be free from cruel and unusual
punishment. In addition to finding Dallas County liable for its treatment
of Lawson, Buchmeyer ordered the county to pay $250,000 in damages for his
pain and suffering.

 6. Mustang Athletes Shine In Sydney; Frolander Wins Gold In 100M Fly
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Former Mustang athlete and 1998 NCAA Men's Swimmer of the Year Lars
Frolander ('99) took the gold medal in the men's 100-meter butterfly at
the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia. Frolander, competing for his
native Sweden, won with a time of 52.00. The butterfly gold is Frolander's
second Olympic medal. He was a member of the Swedish team that won silver
in the men's 4x100M freestyle relay at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, the same
race in which his Mustang teammate Ryan Berube ('96) helped earn gold for
the United States. Frolander also competed in the 100M free and again on
Sweden's 4x100M free relay team, finishing sixth in both events.

SMU's 1999 NCAA Women's Swimmer of the Year, Martina Moravcova ('98, '99),
took two silver medals -- in the 100M fly and the 200M free -- for her
home nation of Slovakia. Moravcova, who became her country's first Olympic
medalist since 1908, also finished fifth in the 50M and 100M free
events. (SMU head coach Steve Collins, who is also Moravcova's personal
coach, served as honorary head coach for the Slovakian team.) Her Olympic
teammates recognized her achievements by choosing her to carry the
Slovakian flag in the closing ceremonies Sunday night. Another SMU
swimmer, Rania Elwani ('99), competed for Egypt in the semifinals of the
women's 50M and 100M freestyle. Incoming first-year student Anu Koivisto
of Finland competed in the women's 200M and 100M backstroke events.

The Mustang Olympic track and field contingent was led by Sweden's Kasja
Bergqvist ('99); the 1999 NCAA champion won the bronze medal in the
women's high jump. Junior thrower Janus Robberts won a seventh-place
finish for South Africa in the men's shot put. Discus throwers Jason Tunks
('99, Canada) and Alex Tammert ('98, Estonia) placed sixth and ninth in
the men's finals; Ian Winchester ('96, New Zealand) and Robert Weir ('85,
Great Britain) also competed. Teri Tunks ('98), an SMU assistant track
coach, threw for Team USA in the women's shot put. Former Mustang
Christophe Epalle (France) and current SMU junior Libor Charfreitag
(Slovakia) competed in the men's hammer throw. Junior Roman Oravec
competed for the Czech Republic in the men's 800M run.

In team sports, Claudia Brassard-Riebesehl ('99) played for the Canada
women's basketball squad, which advanced to the Classification 9-10
(pre-quarterfinal) game and finished the tournament in 10th place.

 7. School Of Theology Receives $12.1 Million In Scholarship Support
------------------------------------------------------------------------

A collective total of $12.1 million has been pledged for scholarships in
Southern Methodist University's Perkins School of Theology. Donors include
15 area conferences in the United Methodist Church's eight-state South
Central Jurisdiction; Charles and Elizabeth Perkins Prothro of Wichita
Falls, Texas; and other individuals in the jurisdiction. The Prothros'
$4.7 million grant matching conference and individual pledges provided
impetus for the highly successful theology scholarship campaign. Their
son, C. Vincent (Vin) Prothro, and his wife, Caren, pledged $1 million to
the Perkins campaign.

The Texas Conference, which serves the Houston-Galveston area, pledged $1
million, matched by the Moody Memorial First United Methodist Church in
Galveston. The remaining conference donors have pledged to raise between
$100,000 and $1 million each, to be matched by the Prothro family and the
Perkins Foundation.

 8. Gift Funds Geurin-Pettus Chair In Politics and Political Economy
------------------------------------------------------------------------

A gift of $2.5 million from Jo Ann and Sherrill Pettus of Graham, Texas,
will establish a new distinguished faculty chair in American politics and
political economy at SMU. The endowed chair will be the first step toward
developing a new graduate degree program in the Department of Political
Science in Dedman College of Humanities and Sciences.

The new faculty chair will be known as the Geurin-Pettus Distinguished
Chair in American Politics and Political Economy. To fill the chair, the
University will seek a scholar whose research and teaching relate directly
to domestic public policy and governmental and fiscal issues. In addition
to teaching at SMU, the chairholder will spearhead development of a
program to include relevant conferences and forums. The Pettus gift also
will help fund this program.

should work out prior to the news conference.

News Conference specifics:
speakers - Mayor Brown and Jeff Skilling

location - Fire Station #6, 3402 Washington Ave.
date - Thursday, February 1, 2001
time - 2pm
duration - approximately 30 minutes

I'd like to emphasize that it would be ideal if all selection committee 
members were present at the news conference. 

I will need bios on each committee member emailed to me by close of business 
Monday, January 29, 2001. These bios will be attached to a press release the 
Mayor's Office is compiling.

Coordination of action plan:
Since we have only 1 week between now and the news conference, Jeff has 
proposed that he take a stab at putting together an initial draft. He will 
then email to all committee members for comments/suggestions and make changes 
accordingly. Hope this works for everyone - if not, give me a call

Subject: Pug Winokur Suggested I Contact You


Dear Jeff,

I just wrapped up a meeting with Pug Winokur, an Enron Board member, and he
suggested I contact you to invite you to participate in a CEO forum we host
called Build Value 2001 CEO Forum to be held on May 1, 2001 at the Fairmont
Hotel in San Francisco, California.  The Build Value 2001 forum is a
powerful venue to share your perspective and insights with CEOs of
high-growth technology companies intent on learning and sharing with one
another.  This year's conference is heavily focused on exploring the
opportunities and challenges in the converging online and offline
marketplaces, and perhaps no other firm understands how to be successful in
this market more than Enron.

The discussion we would like you to join is among CEOs and business leaders
who are in large organizations that have effectively stayed on top of the
wave and embracing technological innovation to succeed.  David Pottruck is
confirmed to speak on behalf of Schwab and we have invited AG Lafley from
P&G and Jeanne Jackson from Walmart to join the discussion.  Your
participation on behalf of Enron would clearly be an integral part of the
discussion.

Now in its fourth year, the Build Value CEO forum has established itself as
the premiere learning forum for business executives intent on building
successful technology related companies. The annual forum attracts a diverse
group (750+) of CEOs and technology leaders who are integral to the
continued growth and purpose of this learning community.  The Build Value
2001 CEO forum is not a typical two-day investor conference. Rather it seeks
to create a living lab of ""how-to"" success stories that can be referenced by
participants throughout the year. This content becomes a valuable guide for
many emerging growth companies and can be reviewed online at
<http://www.buildvalue2001.com>.

Join speakers such as Bob Pittman (AOL), Jeff Mallett (Yahoo!), David
Peterschmidt (Inktomi), Shelby Bonnie (CNet), and Mark Walsh (VerticalNet)
who presented cutting edge topics to a sold out audience of CEOs at last
year's conference titled ""Brands Driving the New Economy"". Prior conferences
have also included corporate visionaries and luminaries such as John Hagel
III & Marc Singer (McKinsey & Co.), Francis Ford Coppola (Coppola
Companies), Howard Schultz (Starbucks), David Aaker (author), Meg Whitman
(eBay), Harry Dent (author/speaker), Bob Fisher (Gap), and Cindy Crawford
(eStyle, Inc.) to name a few.   We anticipate this year's speaker roster to
be even more impressive.

Build Value 2001's continuing strategic sponsors, with whom you will have
many opportunities to interact, include some of the most innovative and
forward thinking players in Silicon Valley today:  Redpoint Ventures, Banc
of America Securities, Silicon Valley Bank, CNET, Heidrick & Struggles,
Cooley Godward and Citron Haligman Bedecarre.  Venture Strategy Partners,
Build Value's founding host, is a venture capital firm focused on
accelerating the growth of emerging businesses across a spectrum of
technologies.

I know your perspective and vision will be greatly appreciated and I, along
with my colleagues, would be honored to have you as a distinguished speaker.
Our office will follow up with you this coming week to confirm your
participation.  In the interim, please feel free to call me directly at
415-558-8600 with any questions or talk with Pug Winokur about the power of
this forum.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,

Joanna

I have put together a team of Analyst interns for a second year to help in

I want to outdo the fundraising of $1400+ (post-matching) we did last year.

I'm writing on behalf of Jeff Skilling, who asked me to let you know that he 
will send you a check in the amount of $200.  

While Jeff would probably be to modest to tell you himself, I thought you 
might be interested to know that he has been named the National MS Society's 
2000 Man of the Year, and will be honored at a dinner on September 30.  He 
has been a big supporter of the MS Society, primarily through his riding the 
MS150 from Houston to Austin since 1997.  This year's ride is April 15-16, 
and he has been busy collecting pledges - $20,000 so far, which will be 
matched by the Enron dollar-for-dollar.  Enron Corp. has the largest MS150 
team in the nation in terms of dollars raised, and this year our goal is 
$350,000.  It appears that our 378-person team has already blown through that 
goal and is well on its way to raising $400,000.  As MS has touched my 
family, I am very proud to be associated with a man and a company who so 
actively support research to find a cure.

I'm sure Jeff will write a personal note when he returns to town and sends 
his check.  In the meantime, good luck with your fund raising, and have a 
nice weekend.

Subject: Fw:


To All Brother Beta's (and El!!),  3 weeks ago Woody Berry and I took a trip
to Rockford, Illinois to visit Phil Morrow, who has been struggling with MS
for the past 12 years.  The pictures tell the rest of the story.  I would
say that speaking for Woody that the trip was very bitter/sweet.  Bottom
line:  count your blessings, we never know what life has in store for us.

I will be hosting my Annual MS Walk/ Party in May.  I have done this for the
last 10 years.  I initially thought it would be a good thing for me to do as
I thought I had MS!!  Fortunately, my Neurologist thinks that I had a small
stroke back in '91 (never thought having a stroke would have been GOOD
news!!).

Now, I host the party in honor of Phil Morrow in hopes that we can find a
cure to help him.  As always, I collect donations from anyone and everyone
who is interested and/or able.  If you would like to send in a donation,
simply write out a check for whatever amount to:   NMSS (National Multiple
Sclerosis Society) and send it to:

Chuck Paul
6193 Forest Hills Dr.
Norcross,  Ga.  30092-4513

My email address is listed below.  If you have any other Beta's who you
think would like to see these pictures, please forward them on.

PS  First game at the new Ford Stadium on the SMU campus will be 9/2/00 at
6PM against KU.  Homecoming this year will be October 28th.  The new stadium
is looking GREAT!  I hope to be at both games but definitely at Homecoming.
Hope to see many of you there.  We will even have a 'tailgating' section
with 'adult beverages' allowed!!!

Just a quicknote to say hello.  Looking forward to the prophesized
letter.

You'll be interested to know that a couple weeks ago, when I was on my
way to Greece to renew my visa, passed Enron's progject at Marmara
Eregilisi, a town on the Maramara Sea, which is the same body of water
that has the island where Abdullah Ocalan (""Apo"", the Kurdish terrorist)
is beng held.  Had read about the project in a Turkish newspaper
(English translation; not ready to read real Turkish newpapers yet)
earlier.  Also read an article about a study Enron did for the US
government about the natural gas pipeline from Baku through Geogia to
the Black Sea coast.  You guys are everywhere.

I also read that The Economist is sponsoring some sort of energy
conference in Ankara (which is suppose to be a gloomy sort of place;
especially this time of year) in the next few weeks.  Are you going?

Least you think all I do is read about Enron, been having the time of my
life here, which is not to say things have been easy.  But I'm still
where things like standing in four different lines at the port office to
pick up a pakage is charming.  (Besides Asia Minor being the birth place
of agriculture, democarcy and Christianity [all, albeit, in the distant
past], it was also the birthplace of buracracy [as you probably know,
the word byzantine comes from Byzantium, the name for Istanbul before it
became Constantinople].)

Hope all is well.

Love,

Mark

Great to see Enron and you doing so well.  Congratulations on the -belated-
CEO ship, the blowout first quarter,
and the recent piece in Bloomberg.

Since we last met Luminant has done a important and impactful work for Enron
(EES, Enron Networks, Global
Sourcing, Broadband among others).  The Oasis and the Websource Intranet
sites are examples of the results of
this work.  Phillippe recently selected Luminant as one five integrators
that Enron will use going forward.

David Quackenbush, Luminants COO, has been personally involved in leading
the work at Enron.  He and
Jim Corey Luminant's CEO would like to have the opportunity of meeting with
you, bringing you up to date
on the work, and inviting you to consider joining the Luminant board.

I am no longer affiliated with Luminant but David asked me to let you know
of their interest.  He will be
following up and seeing if there will be an opportunity for you to meet with
them.

who would like to talk to Enron about setting up power trading in India. As 
India is moving towards de-regulation, he thinks this is the right time to 
start the process. He has high opinion of Enron. He would like a write-up 
about setting up power trading. So that he can discuss this further with 
other officials. I would be happy to work on this project and help Enron 
start power trading in India. Thanks.

Reading thourgh my mail and came to your newest note.  Thanks again for the
communication.

Like I said in earlier note, things seem pretty normal.  Stores without
electricty, but open.  No one seems to be hoarding.  Indeed, except for lack
of electricity I really wouldn't know anything happened, and I walked around
for a couple hours, covering some ground.

It was strange, but I had great trouble getting to sleep last night and
probably only did so minutes before the quake.  Next couple hours was spont
outdoors with the rest of my neighbors.  Took a pretty good walk then, too,
and again saw little damage (though admittedly it was the middle of the
night).  The one good thing is that for the first time in my stay here the
stars were all out, as the city had gone dark.  Quite an experience.

More later,

Mark

Dear Dorothy:

Thank you very much for your note; below I have laid out the agenda for the
meeting for Ken and Jeff's approval:

1. Introduction to Adventis and our work in the Broad band space; - 20 minutes
2.  Ken's brief on Broad Band Services group's way forward: challenges,
issues, aspirations; - 15 minutes
3. Jeff's expectations and views form the corporate center;-10 minutes
4. Adventis' approach, likely routes to partnership;-10 minutes
5. Next steps: JEFF, KEN and our team.- 10/15 minutes

During the second hour with Ken, we wish to address specific points on the
out come of the first meeting to define areas of focus for path forward:

1 Strategic and operational issues for short term value creation, and
long-term robust development of BBS as global player
2. Acceleration capacity at BBS to capture short range opportunities versus
outside assistance.
3. Likely ways we could engage with Enron for both short term and long-term
wins.
4. Time line for creating the upside.

I am sure Ken and Jeff, will have a lot to add. Please do let me know.

Dorothy, given the significant challenges and opportunities ahead for Enron
BBS, we will have four of our senior most partners with deep insights into
Broad band and ASPs/CSPs join the meeting. I will come the night before, if
possible to have dinner with Jeff and/or Ken. Please do let me know the
possibility.

Subject: Seminar on Energy Industry Restructuring



Jeff,

The International Energy Agency would like to invite you to speak at a
one-day Seminar on Energy Industry Restructuring to be held on 22 March 2000
here in Paris.  Enron's unique position in the global gas and electricity
businesses and your personal role in bringing that about would be of great
interest to the audience.

The audience will be composed of senior government officials from IEA member
countries who serve as delegates to three of our ""Standing Groups"" (i.e.,
oversight committees); the Standing Group on the Oil Market, the Standing
Group on Emergency Questions and the Standing Group on the Long-Term.
Chatham House rules will apply (no attribution without permission, no press,
open exchange of ideas).

If your schedule and inclination permits, we would like you to speak for
about 25-35 minutes on corporate objectives and strategies, your experiences
to date and any general plans for the future (that you are permitted to
discuss), with a focus on the gas and electric industries.  Case studies of
particular business developments would be of special interest.

The presentation would be in the second panel of the morning on ""Sectoral
Aspects of Energy M&A Activities from a Company Perspective"".  The 2-hour
session would start  at around 11AM and would include two other speakers
from Europe covering oil; Michel de Fabiani (President of BP France and
chief architect of the BP-Mobl downstream joint venture), who has
tentatively accepted and electricity; M. Saab, Head of Planning for EdF, who
has been invited, but is checking his schedule.

We are attempting to line up senior officials from the FTC, the EU
Competition Authority and a Japanese energy industry authority for an early
afternoon session to discuss ""Public Policy Implications of Energy M&A
Activity"".  You might find some useful insights into the possibly disparate
regulatory mentalities in these three regions.

I would be pleased to send you a complete working agenda for the meeting and
a formal invitation letter.

Please give my best regards to Ken Lay.

David

P.S. You may remember me from the days I was running the Energy Group and
Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. in the 1980s, and for part of the time
following Enron.  I am now Head of the Oil Industry and Markets Division at
IEA and Editor of the IEA Monthly Oil Market Report.  I hope your schedule

today, showing what cities are the best for business and careers.

What city do you think is number one this year? Well, just go to 
http://www.milkeninstitute.org or http://www.forbes.com/bestplaces to find 
out.

This annual ranking of the top 200 metropolitan areas in the United States 
(with a separate ranking for 94 small metros) looks at which metros are the 
most dynamic based on jobs and earnings growth, and high-technology growth 
and output. 

All of the numbers were provided by the Institute's Regional and Demographic 
Studies group as part of its ongoing research into how high-tech impacts 
regional economies.

If you have any questions about the Forbes-Milken Institute ranking, or if 
you wish more information about the Institute or the high-tech work of the 
Regional Studies group, please contact us at (310) 998-2600.

Jim,

I have the list below with the information I have:

Ghatghar  Don't Know
Tata Hydro  Hydro
Koyna   Hydro
Koyna IV  Is a pump storage project, but am not clear on fuel, probably uses 
electric pumps during off peak.  Primary purpose is likely irrigation.
Khaperkheda  Coal
Koradi   Coal
Chandrapur  Coal
Parli   Coal
Uran   Domestic gas, currently in short supply
Trombay  Nuclear
Nasik   Coal
Bhusawal  Coal
BSES   Coal
Dabhol   Naphtha, converts to LNG with Phase II

Additionally, please note that there is no other liquid fuel fired power 
plant in Maharashtra, aside from Dabhol.  The Reliance Patalganga plant is 
still under development and this would be naphtha based when completed, but 
it is not clear that it will go ahead.  There was a scheme to develop liquid 
fuel fired medium sized projects in many states, including a bid for 9 such 
plants in Maharashtra.  None of them are likely to see light of day.

In short, DPC cannot replace any other oil fired plant in Maharashtra with a 
higher heat rate.

Hope this helps.  I will be back in Mumbai next week.  Please let me know if 
additional information is needed.  I am available at 011-91-9821068238 when 
in India.

We are starting the data collection and ratification for the Henwood study in 
earnest, and I am having there representative in India also on Friday.

Enjoyed reading about Dad's and Dave's recollections of Macomb.  But why is
Macomb in their pasts?  When was/is the Delaware game?

Things are ok here.  Have lost a bit of respect for the Firm I am working
with; lots of bluff where there should be preparation; dreams of glory
without the sweat.  Still, I am being treated great.  Second newsletter sent
out last week; with Ismail's help (I got him hired to work with me on the
layout, as the in-house guy not really up to par) and the look much much
better this time.  I like a couple of the articles too (note the one on
international arbitration and the micropower revolution), though the
audience for them is probably pretty small.  Will definitely be sending this
one to some editors.

Today a bit blue, and walked down to the Bosphorus for of a dose of
""renenwal"" by the water.  Got treated to the last of the day's sun catching
both the tops of the (most ugly, except in sunlight) building's lining the
strait's Asian shore and the sterns (right Dad?) of huge tankers heading for
the Black Sea.  Because its Ramazon, and sunset is when everyone breaks
their fasts, I had the quay mostly to myself.  About a mile up the Bosphorus
is a huge suspension bridge, and between its towers was a huge rising full
moon.  Nice scene.

What's up with you all?  Tomorrow is the presenation to our most important
client, Turkcell (on the NYSE).  Is a Power-Point Presentation, the modern
version of a slide show, with audio.  I wrote it and recorded it.
Unfortunatlely, radio vocies don't seem to be inherited traits.  (Indeed, I
do recall Tom working to train his for hours and hours; nothing biological
about that, just hard work.)  Tomorrow night its off to Georgia again, where
I have a little work to do and will (the main purpose for the trip) pick up
my work visa.  (Will stay a few days, despite not having that much work to
do there, and do a bit of sightseeing; might not get there that often in the
future, as once again the Russian's seem to have less than honorable designs
on the place.) Upon my return to Istanbul, the work visa should be followed
in a couple of weeks by my residence permit, at which point I will be legal.
  No more touris visa run every three months!

More later.  Look forward to some new news.

Yours with love,

Mark

you per the policy dated October 27, 1999 concerning entering into agreements 
containing non-solicitation provisions.

Jay Fitzgerald has been negotiating and is about to finalize a services 
agreement with Scient Corporation (Scient will be providing software and 
hardware related services).  It contains a mutual agreement not to solicit 
the other's employees for a one year period.   Jay thinks the major 
beneficiary of that provision will be us, since it is more likely that they 
will want some of our employees rather than the other way around.

Please indicate your approval by reply to this email.  Thank you.

This is the first day of the Kurban Bayram (Holiday of the Sacrifice)
and Istanbul's streets are full of folks in their holiday best.

And blood.

For days cows, lambs, goats, rams, and other big animals, have been
being brought to Istanbul from the countryside.  (I read that in Cairo
you could see people bringing their animals in by cab.)  Tent cites
(consisting of rickety structures of unlumbered wood and huge plastic
tarps) full of these doomed animals have sprung up under bridges, in
garbage filled lots and along the highways.  The city's normal perfume
of car exhaust and coal fumes is now mixed with the heavy smells of the
barnyard.

And, today, the slaughter began.

Pools of blood and rain spotted the pavement in front of my building,
evidence of a recent butchering.  On a muddy hillside in one of the
older neighborhoods south of the Halic (Golden Horn) in Eski (Old)
Istanbul, I saw several women, all smiling, surrounding a man vigorously
chopping away at the rib cage of a cow with an ax.  The cow's recently
skinned hide was spread out neatly beside them, the rest of the animal
in a heap nearby.  I passed three men loading sagging plastic sacks, no
doubt full of the spoils of a recent kill, into the trunk of a car.
(Sorry, but my weak imagination couldn't help but conjure up to images
from Scorcese's ""Goodfellas"".)  By a mosque, three was a lone Ram's head
under a tree.  Its snout was pointing upwards, as if thinking about
stretching a neck that was no longer there to the leaves just above it.
On the sidewalk in front of a butcher shop a man, hacking off the skin
of a decapitated lamb, rolled the body back and forth like a water
balloon.  A few meters away, a pen full of sheep ate their feed
contentedly from a trough.  I looked closely at them, was surprised to
see that they seemed oblivious to the significance of what was going on
right next to them.  Mounds of entrails lay in the gutter of one street.
I walked bye the opening of a narrow alley, from which I was assaulted
by a draft bloated with the now unpleasant order of fresh meat.  Later,
I watched, with absolutely no idea what it meant, a young man put his
fingers into the blood runoff of one butchering then walk to his car and
wipe it on the license plate.

The Kurban Bayram is an extremely important holiday for Moslems, second
only Ramadon (""Ramazon"" in Turkish).  It's the time for the hajj (""hac""
in Turkish), or pilgrimage, to Mecca, which all Moslems of any means are
to make at least once in their lifetimes.  Here, in Turkey, most folks
get at least two days off work, some the entire week.  During the
holiday, throughout the Moslem world, many families buy an entire animal
for sacrifice, using only a part of it themselves, giving the bulk of it
to others, including most importantly the poor.  Some play amateur
butcher, but I have been told the vast majority of them have an ""expert""
do it.  Indeed, the Koran demands that the sacrifice be as quick and
painless as possible.

The holiday itself celebrates the Old Testament story in which Ibrahim
(Abraham to non-Moslems) was ordered by God to sacrifice his son.
Abraham reluctantly agreed, but was given a last minute reprieve and was
allowed to sacrifice a ram instead.  It is a powerful story about belief
and faith (and must give animal rightists a few textual problems).  I
can see why Moslems have picked the story out as paramount.  It
certainly provides an interesting contrast to the New Testament story of
God's sacrifice of his son.

As I walked around Istanbul today I overwhelmed.  The city was a
slaughterhouse, full of, for me, somewhat gruesome contrasts.  Young
girls in flowered dresses and boys in tiny three-piece suits ran around
the streets laughing and playing games, with blood on their shoes.  I
passed a curious boy kicking at some unfortunate creature's stomach,
which had been left on a pile of garbage.  I saw a little girl holding
her mother's hand, smiling at me shyly, as her mom picked through a pile
of discarded intestines.

April 5, 1999

My discontent at the sights of the Kurban, I concluded later, was a bit
sanctimonious.  Americans eat considerable more meat than Turks, it's
only that in the United States the dismemberment is done quite a bit
more discretely.  But why should it be?  Isn't it a better, or at least
a  lot more honest, to understand what the animal part, and animal,
you're eating looked like when it was still alive (including rippling
muscles, forlorn gaze, and all)?  I thought of my canoe trips to Canada,
and how much more meaningful my fish dinner was because I had caught and
cleaned the unlucky critter myself.  A sharpening of reality, I think,
is always a good thing (especially in this time when so much of our
""knowledge"" and ""experience"" comes secondhand through the media,
including, I have to reluctantly admit, my beloved books).  If our
rituals, often the most powerful means of creating reality-blindness,
can be infused with as much truth as possible, all the better I'd say.
(Then, perhaps, when those flimsy dreams we try to kid ourselves with
disintegrate like pieces of wet toilet paper....)

Today is the five-month anniversary of my arrival here in Istanbul.
It's an amazing thing I've done for myself, I think.  I am as close to
totally engaged in my life, and the world around me, as I have ever
been.  It will be hard to live any other way again, I imagine.

In the last week and a half, three terrorists here in Turkey succeeded
only in blowing themselves up, much, I suppose, to their martyred soul's
chagrin.  I've got to hope that these crazy acts are evidence of the PKK
(or whomever) being on its last legs.  There are important elections,
national and local, coming up on April 18th, so we'll probably get a
chance to see just how long those legs are.

Hope all is well.  Drop me a line.

Mark-O

Jeff,

My name is Samuel Pak, and I'm an Analyst in the A/A program.  I will also be 
riding the MS150 with you and the Team this weekend.  As I did last year, I 
am writing an article on the MS150 for the Encounter.  As such, I was hoping 
that maybe we could chat a few minutes at lunch in Bellville or at dinner in 
La Grange.  If this is OK with you, I will find you and introduce myself, and 
we can go from there.

Much Thanks!

truly great Thanksgiving holiday!

Our predictive dialer has evolved into a world-class computer-telephony 
server. Users may now easily add advanced inbound and call blending 
functionality, voice monitoring, voice recording, automated messaging, touch 
tone and interactive voice response (IVR), as well as email and web

Our strong growth and product enhancements continue unabated. Our 
network-wide Graphical Manager and Dynamic Campaign Builder (DCB) are setting 
entirely new thresholds of effectiveness and productivity! Also, we have just 
made yet another release of our Graphical Manager software and will now also 
shortly be releasing an even more expansive version of DCB.

We continue to add customer success profiles. You can view and print these

Dear Jeff,
I am a Partner with Whitehead Mann and rang you today to introduce myself and 
my firm.  We are an executive search consultancy who act for large global 
organizations to find Non-Executive Directors(NED)for their Boards.  At any 
one time, we have a number of European clients who are keen to have American 
nationals join their Boards due to their growing interests in the US.

I am approaching you to see if you would ever entertain taking on a NED 
position.  I have a specific client in mind which is a Paris-based, global 
industrial company with worldwide revenues in excess of $15 billion.

I know that you have just returned from holiday and have a busy schedule over 
the next few weeks, but I would be grateful if you could let me know if you 
would be interested in talking further about Board appointments.  I can be 
reached at 212 551 3552 or via e-mail at your convenience.

I look forward to hearing from you.

For what it is worth, I  wanted to provide my recommendations of individuals 
to oversee the Program.  The major business units should be represented so 
that there is not a perception that any unit is more important than another.  
Additionally, if they have all bought in and agree it should make the 
facilitation of rotations, etc. less difficult to accomplish.  It should be a 
very small group and consist of individuals who are well respected in the 
organization.

Dave Delainey - ENA   (ENA has 50% of the Associates and Analysts and Dave 
has been very supportive of the Programs' objectives.  He has facilitated one 
of the Super Saturdays and offered to do others.  He has also agreed to 
facilitate the Associate PRC).

Dan Leff - EES  ( Dan is the role model in the organization for leadership 
and support of the goals and objectives of the Program and the Company.  At 
his direction, his entire organization has been involved in the recruiting 
process and the rotation process.  He actually set up a Steering Committee of 
his senior executives who meet with Program Management on a monthly basis  
regarding the Associates/Analysts.  Dan has been extremely supportive from 
day one, prior to anyone being told it would affect their PRC rating.  He is 
also the Executive lead on two (2) schools.  The recruiters, candidates, 
staffers and Associates & Analysts love him.  If I had to choose one person 
in the organization whom I would give an award for his dedication to and 
participation in the Program, it would be Dan. )

Jim Fallon - EBS  (Jim has shown greater involvement in the Program lately.  
He has interviewed on Super Saturday on several occasions and has agreed to 
chair the Analyst PRC)

John Sherriff - London (There continues to be a disconnect between London and 
Houston.  It would be helpful to have John actively involved.)

VAR, expiry phenomena, and the other issues that are crucially important to 
be able to effectively manage risk, (and prevent frequent violations), you 
should know this is the most important immediate issue we face.  Even with 
the IT constraints, which Beth Perlman has done a good job addressing for me, 
our organization is willing to do anything to help manage this process.  I 
have committed to Beth that will we help her find people with the ultimate 
goal or being able to run real time VAR calculations.  Rick's idea of 
allocating VAR in times like this would certainly be helpful (while we work 
to perfect our risk management capabilities), but is only a short term 
solution. 

On another note, I really believe we will see gas prices significantly higher 
this year, and have been working with Gary Hickerson to identify the best 
equity plays as well.  Is there a way to further capitalize on our view, that 
is, can Enron do anything structurally to capture more of this opportunity? 
This gas move might be one of those once in a 100 year environments. (Board 
permission, special vehicle, asset purchase, etc?)
 
Just as an FYI, even if all the ammonia and methane plants go down, the Nukes 
run at +95% capacity, and there are no events to interrupt supply, we think 
gas storage will end up at 2.55-2.6 Tcf at the end of the injection cycle.

Thanks for getting back to me.  You probably saved us quite a bit of time and 
money.  

It looks like half of the City of London has been duped into helping E.ON

auctions versus pre-arranged sales dressed up for the shareholders.

Dear Neil,

Jeff asked me to let you know that he will be at Paul Hobby's open house
this evening and hopes to see you there to discuss Genesis Park and Vitol.
In the event you two do not cross paths there, please let me know and we'll
see what we can do to schedule a meeting before the end of the year.

Subject:  Genesis Park


Jeff, I've been meaning to corner you at one of the YPO functions to spend
a
minute discussing a couple of topics.  First and foremost, I wanted to
introduce Genesis Park which is a ""new economy"" investment company that's
been recently founded here in Houston by Paul Hobby, Fred Lummis, Steve
Gibson, Peter Shaper, Bruce Herzog and myself.  Paul and I were hoping to
have an opportunity to spend 30 minutes with you in the next few weeks to
describe in person what we're all about.  And to be clear, we're not
looking
for Enron money, we are raising money from private individuals.  We've
already met with Jay Fitzgerald and Steve Horn to establish the
Enron/Genesis business relationship.

I also wanted to get your views on Enron's approach to oil trading and
whether the Vitol Group presented an opportunity.  Frankly, I think Vitol
is
an excellent acquisition target although the success they've enjoyed in the
last year or two will make it a bit more difficult.  They have an
unbelievable franchise, but they also have some fundamental weaknesses
which
could be exploited to Enron's benefit.  I'm shooting in the dark here but
hopefully it's worth some discussion.

If you can free some time during this busy holiday period to meet, it would
be greatly appreciated.  Paul and I could come to your office, or possibly
you could come to our ""offices"" over on Hermann Park.  We're buying 17
acres
on Hermann Park adjacent to the Park Lane Towers which we plan to develop
into a technology park.  For the time being, we are officing in a high tech
shed on the property!

Please let me know.  Thanks/Neil.

    Thank you again for extending me an invitation to be on your committee to
select the new Houston Fire Chief.  I look forward with much enthusiasm and
excitement to working with you and the committee members on this very
important project.

    I enjoyed our visit at the Doubletree immensely. It was great walking
down memory lane and recalling our days in Cambridge. We probably passed each
other at Harvard Square at some point during our time there.  As I said, I am
a great admirer of you and ENRON. The innovation, creativity and unique
(though soon to be widely copied) business plan make ENRON one of Houston's
(and the nation's, maybe also California's in the near future) great assets.

     Since the subject came up in our conversation, I will add a short
personal note. After reviewing several potential transactions this week, it
is quite possible that my partners and I will be entering into a ""business
defining"" transaction in the next two months. Since I am a lousy golfer, I
will be exploring new challenges.

Sheri:

Thanks for the response.  Our next dinner is scheduled for September 25, at
the moment I'm not sure who the other invitees would be.  Jerry would
probably have a better idea as he puts together the guest list for each
event and may already have something in mind.  That's actually another
reason why I think we should leave the call tomorrow on the calendar.
Depending on Mr. Skillings availability/interest Jerry might want to
reconfigure his invitee list for the most appropriate mix of people.

Probably the best thing is for the call to go ahead, that way Jerry can
brief Mr. Skilling on our plans for the remaining dinners throughout the
year and Mr. Skilling can decide on the best one for him to attend.

Does that sound feasible to you?

I write on behalf of Jerry Murdock, who is currently in Europe.  Mr.
Murdock
asked me to pass on the following information regarding your telephone call

As for my Cyprus trip, I flew into Lafkosia, the Turkish controlled half of
a town that the Greeks call Nicosia (which is probably the name that shows
up on the map).  From there went to a town called Maras (Greek name Varosha)
on the east coast.  Actually stayed in the contiguous town named Gazimagusa
(Famagusta to the Greeks).  (Just the name confusion suggests some pretty
deep problems on Cyprus, doesn't it.)  Have been working on an piece about
Maras for the last few days. Think its a winner.  Maras has been a ghost
town since the Turkish ""peace operation"" (i.e. invasion) in 1974, its empty,
spooky beach lined by abandoned high rise hotels.  Could get only so far as
a militarized border fence.  Should be timely in light of UN sponsored
""proximity talks"" between the two sides that continue in Geneva on January
31st.

After going to Girne (Kyrenia), I returned to Turkey by a hydrofoil, which
though not similar in design probably close to the size of the ferry we used
to cross from SF to Marin.  I suppose that it riding above the waves at
times made things more smooth, though it didn't seem that way.  (Not even
sure those things are to be used on rough seas.) Occasionally when we hit a
big roll the bottom of the boat would drop back down to the sea with a huge,
literally nauseating slap.  (The boat equivalent of a belly flop I suppose.)
  I think the skipper, to avoid the roughest of the seas, cut directly over
to the Turkish coast, which we then followed east to the port of Tasucu.  I
guess it was probably a wise strategy, but more than doubled the time (and
discomfort).  Still, especially now consigned to memory, a great experience.

It's snowing here too, pretty hard.  First big one for Istanbul, though the
rest of Turkey has been hit hard already.  (For example, I was wearing sun
glasses on my train ride back here, to cut down the snow glare.)  Most of
the snow now falling seems to be melting on the ground.  Besides being
beautiful (from the comfort of inside), my English lesson (I'm the teacher,
believe it or not) was cancelled, so I'm excited to get back to my writing.

Things go well.  Thanks for the note.

Love,

Mark-O

ral=20
months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=
=20
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=
 =20
Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=
=20
and our position on California energy issues.

What happened in California

The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=
ly=20
and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=
eased=20
the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=
=20
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=
t,=20
predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20
percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.

In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=
=20
factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=
=20
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=
=20
power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=
=20
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=
ng=20
term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=
n=20
California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=
e=20
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20
while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=
t=20
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.

Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=
ed=20
in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20
competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=
le=20
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20
regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.

In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=
ion. =20
Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=
=20
generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=
=20
spot prices.

At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=
=20
the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=
hich,=20
if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.

Enron=01,s Role

Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=
ix=20
the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20
politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:

? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=
=20
state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=
=20
same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20
market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=
e=20
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=
ts=20
for our customers.
? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=
=20
the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=
=20
protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.

You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20
power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=
=20
the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=
 of our=20
customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:

? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20
market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=
ly=20
from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20
allowing EES to access lower utility rates.
? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =
to=20
receive the financial benefits of their contract prices.
? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=
=20
with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20
reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.

Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=
=20
crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=
=20
power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=
ers=20
with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=
=20
demand for our products and services.

The Solution

The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=
, the=20
state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=
et=20
and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.

Increasing Supply

California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=
=20
short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=
s=20
than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=
y=20
must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=
=20
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20
displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=
=20
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20
facilities.

Reducing Demand

Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =
=20
They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=
=20
market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=
d=20
at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=
.

Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market

In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=
=20
term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=
ds=20
of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=
. =20
Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=
ir=20
price risk.

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions

The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20
greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=
=20
arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=
er=20
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=
=20
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=
=20
needed.

Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=
,=20
while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=
=20
worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work=
ed;=20
and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=
,=20
which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20
ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether =
it=20
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall=
ey=20
or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20
shortage worse.

The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20
California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that=
=20
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20
constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in=
=20
California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20
generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road=
s=20
and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.

As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t=
he=20
crisis from the media, it=01,s important for you to know this:  We at Enron=
 will=20
continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real=20

Dera Mr. Skilling,

Just a short e-mail to invite you to a meeting that I will be having with
Carl Carter in your on-line development team at 1.00pm on the 27th floor in
your offices located at 1400 Smith.

Financial Market Solutions (FMS) is a leading financial software company
located in Bellevue, Washington. The company is dedicated to the development
and implementation of Internet-based trading solutions for institutions in
the global financial marketplace.  The central component of all FMS
solutions is the Universal Trading Platform (UTP), which is a dynamic
web-based platform that enables unlimited numbers of simultaneous users to
access the system and execute trades on a fully automated basis. This basic
premise distinguishes FMS from other solution providers and gives our
clients the ability to more effectively manage the liquidity of multiple
users, trading over the Internet on a single platform. The UTP has been
fully developed as a complete Foreign Exchange dealing system, however, the
same platform can be used for transactions in any tradable financial
instrument.

FMS has employed a team of expert software designers and technicians as well
as experienced professionals from the financial markets, who together have
designed and developed the UTP to transform the way the FX product is
delivered to end-users. The platform is equally suited to the needs of large
institutional users as well as retail investors. The FMS system, using the
latest technology, is the most advanced on-line trading system available
today and will likely shape the FX business model of the future.

We have made some majorprogress over the last 15 months and are poised to
announce some key relationships that will have a mojor impact in the FX
industry.

I understand that you are very busy, and that this invitation is unsolicited
but as they say nothing ventured nothing gained.

Hope you enjoy it.

*  *  *

Maras, The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus -- Attached to the rusting
chain-link fence I am approaching are several blood red signs, on which are
stenciled both the black silhouette of the top half of a faceless soldier
holding a rifle and a warning, in Turkish, that ""Fotograf Cekmek Yasaktir
[To Take Photographs Is Forbidden]"".  The fence, no longer quite plumb in
the soft sand, seems to stumble across the beach, eventually ending at a
gently lapping Mediterranean. There a tangle of wires attached to the fence
extends a short way into the surf, making anyone's effort to outflank it
obviously intentional.  The Turkish soldiers patrolling the non-man's land
beyond, to the south, could thus treat such an intruder, I suppose, in
whatever way they might see fit.

In the other direction, the fence, before it has completely left the beach,
cuts sharply north, running in front of the hulks of four empty resort
hotels.  Above them in the deep blue of the pre-dusk sky hangs a crescent
moon, the same phased moon that graces the flags of both Turkey and the
Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.  One of the hotels still has the
remnants of an identifying sign, with just two of its six letter Greek name
remaining.  Another hotel, the smallest and no doubt at one time the
quaintest, has slatted wooden shutters covering the windows and doors
leading out to tiny porches.  Some of the shutters have rusted off their
hinges then fallen forward against the porch railings, and now point out to
sea as if giving urgent warning.  Others hang limply, defeated, from a
single remaining hinge.
Most surprisingly, every one of the windows I can see in the hotels is
either missing or broken.  I am taken back by such thoroughness, given that
the most likely motivation was vindictiveness.  I struggle to find a loftie=
r
one, wondering if there was perhaps some valid security consideration, such
as making these somewhat strategically set buildings unattractive to
squatters.  Maybe -- though I find this thought the most troubling -- it ha=
d
been done just for the fun of it.





The fence I am walking along marks the border between inhabited and
uninhabited Maras, the Turkish Cypriot's name for the town Greek Cypriots
call Varosha.  The uninhabited part has been off limits since the Turkish
army invaded Cyprus in 1974.  Before that invasion the small Turkish Cyprio=
t
minority had lived uneasily amongst the Greek Cypriot majority, though in
the years since 1960, when Cyprus was given its independence by the English=
,
periodic outbreaks of inter-communal violence had led to increased
segregation and emigration.  The invasion, launched after a coup on the
island and another particularly vicious spat of violence, eventually put an
end to even this limited association -- as it did the worst of the violence=
.
  The Turkish army went on to occupy roughly the northern most 40% of the
island, which was accompanied and followed by one of the last century's all
too familiar mass cross-migrations.  The northern ""half"" is now home to
nearly all of the island's Turkish Cypriots, close to 20% of the total
population.

The border between the north and south, known as the Atilla Line, is one of
the many UN patrolled ""blue lines"" in the world.  Maras actually falls
within Northern Cyprus, with the Attila Line further to the south.  It is
controlled now by the Turkish army.  At the time of the invasion the town
had been a thriving, up and coming resort town, run mostly by Greek
Cypriots.  Indeed, all over Cyprus, since its independence -- despite the
periodic, deadly violence -- tourism had been booming.  But here in Maras,
at least, the boom is no more.  The forty or so thousand Greek Cypriots who
once owned, ran or otherwise worked there, fled in panic before the
advancing Turkish army, reportedly leaving behind uncleared breakfast dishe=
s
on tables and washing on lines, some forgetting to turn off lights that
burned on and on for years.

UN sponsored ""proximity talks"" between the North and the South  -- called
proximity talks because the negotiating leaders will not met face to face -=
-
started in New York on December 4th.  They are set to continue in Geneva
this January 31st.  The return of Maras to its former mostly Greek Cypriot
owners, or more precisely their return to it, is no doubt high on this
meeting's (thus far secret) agenda, as it has been over the years at the
many similar, though always fruitless, negotiations.  This time around,
however, expectations are running higher than usual, primarily because of a
positive change in the dynamic between the two side's by far most important
sponsor states, Turkey and Greece.  Turkey, for example, has recently
acquired candidacy status within the European Union, which commits it to
resolving among other things its disputes with EU member Greece.  Greece, o=
n
the other hand, has lately suffered a series of embarrassments on the
international stage, the biggest of which was being caught last February
having given sanctuary to fugitive Kurdish separatist leader -- and
terrorist in most people's minds -- Abdullah ""Apo"" Ocalan.  Coupled with th=
e
significant good will garnered in the wake of the tremendous assistance
Turkey and Greece gave each other after their twin earthquake disasters las=
t
year, the two countries just may be willing to push their client states
toward a deal.





The point where the fence meets the sea marks the end of the gentle curve o=
f
the short beach I am walking.  Behind me, at this beach's other end, is
inhabited Maras' nicest hotel (oddly sporting an English name, the Palm
Beach Hotel).  If you looked in that direction, taking in only the fine
hotel, the attractive beach, the dark blue sea, you might think you were in
a tourist paradise.  But this is no paradise.  As I walk the last few feet
to the fence I begin to see another beach emerge, much longer than the one =
I
am on, sweeping south most of the way to the horizon.  There are more
hotels, which I knew from what I had read were also empty.  But my reading
has not prepared me for the monstrous proportions of it all.  First, in the
distance, one, two, three empty hotels quickly come into view, then, more
slowly, dozens more.  At the fence, with the entire beach now visible, I
count more than thirty of them, and these just on the waterfront.

Just beyond the fence are a few pieces of ancient playground equipment
scattered about the sand.  I try to imagine the happy cries of the children
as their parents, more than twenty- five years before, pushed them round an=
d
round in dizzying circles on the miniature merry-go-around, now rusted and
partially buried by drifted sand.  There is a long slide too, though
half-tumbled down, one of its rusted supports having twisted and collapsed
after so many years of weather and neglect.  My own memories of childhood
end at no such place now trapped inside a militarized no-man's land.  How
different life must seem to those whose memories do.  What sorts of dreams
are built on this type of innocence lost?

I turn around and walk to the Palm Beach Hotel, along the way wondering if
it was merely luck that had left it on the business side of the fence.  On
its porch I chose a chair, since it has become cold, near a partly cracked
door through which comes a warm draft.  I order a cup of tea.  As the
evening grows darker, so does the abandoned town spread out before me.  The
crescent moon is now higher in the sky and, together with a strategically
placed star, provides a tiny bright exclamation point over the entire disma=
l
scene below.

At that moment two energetic young men burst through the door.  The bigger
of the two is gripping the arm of the other, directing him forward to the
porch's railing.

""Bak [look]!"" he says in Turkish, gesturing out toward the sea with a broad
sweep of his free arm.  ""Harika, degil mi [Wonderful, isn't it]?""

""Evet, cok guzel [Yes, very beautiful]"", his friend agrees.

They stand gazing out over the sea, though after a brief moment I see the
smaller man's head turn toward the darkened hulks that line the shore.  The
bigger man glances at his friend, sees where he is looking, then looks
himself.  They are both silent for quite some time before the bigger man
returns his attention to his friend, squeezes his arm.  His friend, as if
awakening from a trance, slowly pulls his gaze from the ruins, smiles up at
his companion.  After two identical, simultaneous shrugs, they chuckle
uneasily, shaking their heads as they do.

When they turn to return to the door, I holler out to them. ""Baris mumkun m=
u
[Is peace possible]?""

They stop, look at me with frowns of curiosity.  ""Nerelisiniz [Where are yo=
u
from]?""  It is the big one who had taken the lead.

""Amerikali""yim [I'm an American].""

His frown deepens, though now for a different reason.  ""Belki dort, bes yil
sonra [Maybe four, five years from now], belki hic bir zaman yok [maybe
never].""

""Ama, ne hakkinda otuz bir ocak, bir yeni baris gurusmesi [But, what about
January 31st, the new peace negotiations] =01(?""

""Hah!"" he exclaims, interrupting me. ""Her zamen yeni baris gorumesi var
[There are always new peace negotiations]!""

He thereupon dismisses my inference with the same sweeping arm gesture he
used to introduce, to his friend, the sea.

This note builds on the earlier voice mail, and a memorandum I have sent to  
you, following the Dave Dorman meeting. Given the initial ground work done 
by  
our team at ATT leadership level, the meeting between Jeff and David Dorman,  
we think did go as expected by us. I am sure Dave and Stewart, along with  
Jeff have shared their views of the meeting, and do feel positive about ?the  
process forward. 

Our take on the meeting is as follows: 

1. Dave Dorman is open and eager to explore ways ATT and Enron could  
cooperate across the board. 

2. Dave wants to move fast, but at a pace that will work within ATT, and is  
strategically sound for both the organizations 

3. He is now looking forward to specific value propositions from  
Enron-Adventis team, which he is prepared to discuss with us. 

4. On that basis I am sure he will guide us to the most appropriate guys  
within ATT who will need to understand and act on the value propositions. 

In view of the above the real work begins now. As discussed with Dave and  
Stewart, we will further reinforce our commitment to develop, and take the  
basic proposals with ATT forward. Our team is already on the job and will  
meet with Stewart early this week. 

I did indicate to both Dave and Stewart that we will like to take the next  
steps in a most expeditious and matured fashion so that all the strategic  
possibilities to create the new bandwidth dynamics between the two companies  
could be achieved. 

Given that there were some hesitation within Enron on the out come of the  
first meeting with ATT, we committed to the last 2.5 weeks of work with a  
reduced fee structure. Now that the first major step has been successfully  
taken, we plan to work with you along our normal professional fee schedule.  

As we do want to move as fast as possible and if at any point indications 
are  
that the desired out come will be difficult to achieve we could stop and  
review progress. As a result, although not common, we are willing to work  
with a weekly rate, adjusted to professional fees of $75,000/week and out of  
pocket expenses. In addition of course for an engagement of this nature 
which  
essentially leverages our firms professional credibility and trust in the  
industry, our clients pay us on the basis of successful execution of the  
alliance formation along preset milestones.  

Given the strategic nature of this engagement, and our commitment to assist  
you with all the major Telcos, -- incumbents and new, we will welcome to  
learn from you the basic structure of a formula which Enron is most  
comfortable with; typically in other situations in my professional life, we  
have been rewarded in three stages: 

1. On signing of ?the letter of intent(s) 
2. On ?signing of the agreement(s) 
3. On launch of the first project (s) 

Ken, while we look forward to formalizing the above, please enure we sustain  
and if not increase the momentum gained from the first summit meeting last  
Thursday. If we do the right things, the upside is indeed huge. We of course  
should also start thinking through how to build the same kind of work  
dynamics with the other Telcos, in most we do enjoy similar professional  
trust. 

We will call you tomorrow to firm up the next 3 -4 weeks of ?work --  
documentation of value propositions, actions, meetings, and decisions. 

Regards, 

Partha S Ghosh

Sheri:

Thanks for the response.  Our next dinner is scheduled for September 25, at
the moment I'm not sure who the other invitees would be.  Jerry would
probably have a better idea as he puts together the guest list for each
event and may already have something in mind.  That's actually another
reason why I think we should leave the call tomorrow on the calendar.
Depending on Mr. Skillings availability/interest Jerry might want to
reconfigure his invitee list for the most appropriate mix of people.

Do you have any dates for future dinners in mind?  The vast majority of

Probably the best thing is for the call to go ahead, that way Jerry can
brief Mr. Skilling on our plans for the remaining dinners throughout the
year and Mr. Skilling can decide on the best one for him to attend.

Does that sound feasible to you?

I was trying to get a copy of the expense report of Swanswalk (the company

cleared customs in the U.K. If you recall, I sent you a copy of the report a

did can you please fax me a copy in the U.K at 011-44-2078239871?

Subject: Last call for tickets


Various Beta Buttheads,
   OK, the deadline is fast approaching.  We're inside two minutes to play
and I need to know the game plan.  As of this day Oct. 2, here's what I have
confirmed in tickets ordered so that we all may sit together at this year's
homecoming game:
Mannino/1, Beek/1, Jordan/1, Artie/1, Wallace/1, Elvis/2, Grumbles/2,
Glass/3, Chuckles/1, J. Miller/2, Shack/1, Space/8 (he's bringing all of
Elzie's living relatives), Hutch/2, Fullerton/2, Coburn/2, Jansson/5 (he's
bringing all of Mom Pinchbeck's living relatives), Rossell/2, and Carl
Hohl/2 (he thinks...not sure because he never was).
    Now, if there are ANY OTHERS, you have about 48 hours because I need to
order these things when I get back in town on the 5th.  So if any of you
reading this want some, give me an email.  Also think about recruiting
others not on my email list that you think might not yet know about all
these plans.
     WE ARE ABSOLUTELY GOING TO ROCK THE NEW STADIUM.  I've already
contacted officer Caffey and he's given us yet another reprieve to behave
any damned way we want to, complete with SMU Secuity protection.


Yours in -kai-

identify 2 representatives for the Associate and Analyst PRC process and 1 
individual as commercial staffing lead.  The criteria for these individuals 
are as follows:

PRC Representatives
The PRC for Associates and Analysts will be conducted like the VP and MD 
process.   A committee selected by Executive Committee members will 
facilitate the process.  The Office of the Chairman believes that 
participation in the Associate and Analyst PRC should be a platform for 
exposure to election to the next level in the organization.  Consequently, 
Associate PRC representatives should be Vice Presidents who are on promotion 
track to MD and Analyst representatives should be Directors who are on 
promotion track to Vice President. 

Commercial Staffing Leads
 We need your assistance to determine accurate hiring targets to ensure that 
the talent we attract will be valued and utilized meaningfully.   The Office 
of the Chairman is ultimately holding each CEO accountable for working with 
the Program Staffing Coordinators to staff the talent and to determine the 
hiring goals.  The CEO may delegate this responsibility to a highly 
respected, interested, senior commercial person.  This responsibility should 
not be delegated to an HR representative.
Please provide the names by end of the day tomorrow,  5/9/00.  Thanks, to 
those of you who have responded.

This picture was taken in the Bitterroot National Forest in Montana on
August 6, 2000 by a fire behavior analyst from Fairbanks, Alaska by the name
of John McColgan with a Digital camera.  Since he was working while he took
the picture, he cannot sell or profit from it so you might otherwise not get
to see it.

I have a dream.  In it you send out an E-Mail:  Will every Enron employee 
that has been wronged by Enron let me know.  I will personally see to it that 
all wrongs are redressed.

I worked for a big company that at one time abused people working for me.  My 
workers called a slow down on me.  My responsibilities could not be fulfilled 
with the slow down.  So I told my management  ""You helped cause the problem.  
So now please help me solve it.""  Luckily for me my management agreed.  They 
hosted a dinner for my supervisors and representatives of my workers at one 
of the best Steak Restaurants in town.  Before, during and after drinks, 
steaks, desserts and cigars, we listened and spoke.  Management's words and 
body language said  ""We agree we wronged you.  We apologize.  We promise to 
try our best not to do it again.  Now please let us all get back to work.""  
Nobody threatened anybody that night, and yet next day I had fully productive 
workers.

I have a dream that Enron can do as good, or better.  After all, are we not 
the best at just about every thing else?

I refuse to believe that any corporation can be the very best if they do not 
right wrongs.

I am very interested at hearing any comments you may have on the subject.

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to 
Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this 
weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise 
$50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you 
consider helping him reach his goal?

contributions for Turkey's recovery efforts.  Turkey has a population of
some 65 million, up from only some 14 million at its birth in 1923.  The per
capita income is just over $3,000 a year, close to Mexico's.  The areas hit
so hard by the recent earthquake have experienced growth rates in the last
few decades that probably have few precedents in human history.  Istanbul,
for example, has grown from some 1 to 1.5 million people 30 years ago to
what some estimate to be a population of between 12 to 15 million today!
Most of these folks are from or are descendants of poor families who moved
from the countryside to the industrial cities looking for a better life.
The demand they created for housing, obviously, contributed to some of the
corner cutting that has exacerbated so badly the recent disaster.

I am sure you have access to trustworthy organizations through which to
distribute your contributions, but in case you don't why not try the
American Red Cross,  P.O. Box 37243, Washington DC 20013; 1 (800) helpnow;
www.redcross.org.

Thanks,

 - of the 10 resumes, 4 originated from the City's initial recruiting efforts 
and 6 have been received since Enron became involved in the efforts. However, 
to date, no resumes have been forwarded from Recruiters. 
Recruiters - Unfortunately, I have had to take control of this situation by 
force. It appears we will no longer seek assistance from two of the three 
executive recruiters, Preng Assoc and Kern & Assoc. Korn Ferry has been 
contacted directly by me and redirected down the correct path. Hopefully we 
will have some resumes shortly.
Meetings/discussions with related parties - I have met or had telephone 
conversations with a total of 8 individuals. I expect to meet with six more 
over the next couple of weeks. I plan to ride with Dr. Persse, the medical 
director, on 1/28 and to spend an entire shift (24 hours) with the 
fire-fighters from District 34 - the result of a two hour meeting with a 
Chauffeur (who initiated the meeting after reading the bulletin 
Hollingsworth's office sent out on me) who invited me to spend 24 hours with 
his fire station to experience first hand what they do. (I understand that 
one of the men who posed for the 2001 Fire Fighter Calendar are in his fire 
station - JUST KIDDING!)

Jeff,
I had called Sherrie to see if we could meet, together with my partner,
Jordan Larimore, now that we are both reaffiliated with Lehman.
The proposed meeting was not about Lehman's Private Venture offering per se,
but rather about reestablishing a broader Private Client relationship
between you and Lehman.
I look forward to hearing from you and wish you well on your trip.

Subject: My Resignation, and a Question

Jeff-

As you may know, I have (somewhat reluctantly) decided to resign from Enron.  
For some time now, I have wanted to take some time off, and had asked Whalley 
about the possibility for a six month unpaid, unvested sabbatical.  Primarily 
for reasons of precedence, he was unwilling to pursue this option, which, 
while it is disappointing to me, I accept.

The purpose of this note is twofold.

First, I would like to thank you for making this company the great place it 
is today, and for giving me the opportunity to have a great career here.  I 
will forever look upon my nine plus years with Enron fondly.

Second, I would like to ask you as the administrator of the 1997 Long Term 
Incentive Plan to allow me to explore opportunities in the venture capital 
community without triggering non-compete provisions with regard to future 
payouts.  I very much enjoyed my brief role in venture capital, and have some 
very good contacts in that area here in New York.  Since NetWorks decided to 
cease operations in that business earlier in the year, I should not think 
that Enron would view anything I might do there as competitive, especially if 
I were not working directly in the energy space with an Enron competitor.

At present, I am planning to spend my time at least through the summer 
enjoying, and travelling with, my family.  I have nothing planned 
professionally as of yet, but wanted to take the opportunity to drop you this 
note while I might still be viewed positively (I hope that's not too 
presumptuous!).

Please let me know your thoughts on this non-compete provision as I would not 
wish for anything to be awkward for us going forward.

Again Jeff, thanks for many great memories, and as an Enron shareholder, keep 
up the great work!

Jay

Free remote energy management solution helps you to manage rising energy 
bills.
NewPower is launching a revolutionary technology pilot to the first 500 
people to sign up in the Houston area.  The NewPower Connections Remote 
Energy Management Solution is a pilot program designed to give consumers 
control of their thermostat via the Internet.  The program will allow 
thermostats to be adjusted from anywhere, with any Internet-enabled device, 
including computers, web-enabled cell phones, palm OS devices, or pocket 
PCs.  Sears Home Central will install and service the Remote Energy 
Management Solution at no charge throughout the duration of the pilot 
program.  For a typical household, the three-month pilot could result in up 
to 10 percent to 15 percent utility bill savings, based on personal usage and 
the size of your home.  


Be among the first to participate absolutely free.
Enrollment with the NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution 
pilot program starts May 14 and continues through the end of the month.  For 
more information about this offer, visit NewPower's table located in the 
Plaza of the Enron Building near the down escalator from 11:00 a.m. to 2 p.m. 
during the week of May 14.  To become a pilot participant you need only to be 
a homeowner in the Houston area and have Internet access.  You do not even 
have to be a NewPower electricity customer to participate.  For more 
information about NewPower Connections, send an e-mail to

With the recent burst of the Internet and communications bubble in the public 
equity markets, I wanted to send you an email describing our position, 
exposure and ongoing strategy.  Our aggressive use of accounting management 
vehicles, and early sales of positions has significantly reduced our 
accounting volatility and economic exposure.  Hopefully, the following points 
will address the appropriate issues.

Currently we have invested $108 million in 22 companies.  Of that, 
approximately $80 million still has accounting exposure.  The other $28 
million invested has either been hedged or already written down.  Our 
disciplined use of Fair Value accounting has allowed us to minimize 
accounting risk by not writing up investments simply because of improving 
market conditions.
Specifically - Avici, Sycamore, and FastForward have generated approximately 
$180 million in earnings this year.  DEN, Salus Media, and IAM.com have 
combined for $9 million in writeoffs.
Recently, I have done a review of our portfolio and I believe our accounting 
loss exposure for 2001 is limited.  Over 80% of our portfolio companies have 
raised enough capital to sustain them through all of 2001.  So, if the 
markets (private and public) are closed, I do not believe these companies 
will risk bankruptcy during 2001.  Also, our discipline of only co-investing 
with big partners helps assure these companies will continue to get funding.

Going forward, we are making certain revisions to our strategy to take 
compensate for, and take advantage of, the weak markets.
Limiting venture investments to technology companies that we have a 
competitive advantage in assessing the technology risk.  Also, moving our 
venture effort earlier stage to take more technology risk and less market 
risk.
We are beginning to look at other types of private equity investments.  There 
are many public companies, whose stock prices are at 10% or less of their 
highs.  I still believe that the fundamentals of the industries indicate that 
the vast majority of these companies will go bankrupt.  However, there will

Subject: tent


Elvis,
Woody sent me a note today.  In it he mentioned that he has the old roll
book from the fraternity house.  He said he took it because the young
fellas had no respect for the past.
This reminded me of an idea I had earlier.  I was thinking of the banner
for our tent and thinking of some way of making it clear that it was the
Old Betas tent...and beer.  I was thinking of 'Original House Betas',
'Silver/Grey Betas'(...though I've become a silver-gray, my heart keeps
time and measure... with Beta Theta Pi, to find my highest pleasure.
Samuel N Wilson, Hanover '72) or something like that to distinguish our
tent from the active Beta tent.
I'm sure there are any number of clever titles that accomplish the same
thing....keeping a bunch of young beer guzzling freeloading strangers out
of our fricking tent!
That's all.

Subject: NewPower & Enron

Mr. Skilling,
First, let me congratulate you on being appointed to CEO of Enron. Very 
exciting news!

Mr. Lay may have spoken to you about NewPowers' desire to be the premier 
energy provider to Enron employees.
- If you had a moment, please take the time to read and reflect on the 
opportunity of this project.
- As you will notice, I was assigned to lead the project and am looking 
forward to working with Enron (again).

I look forward to  the opportunity of seeing you again, while I am in Texas; 
and I hope that you will find it worth your while to provide input to this 
project.
Having a good understanding of Enron and it's culture, I strongly believe 
that your direct support will have a huge effect on the success of the 
project.

Below is the Email that Mr. Lockhart sent to Mr. Lay:

As part of NewPower's plan to enter Texas, we would appreciate your support 
to implement a plan to offer Enron Employees the opportunity to sign up to 
NewPower when deregulation opens on February 15th.  We believe that an Enron 
Employee Exclusive offer for NewPower electricity and customized offers to 
employees at Enron's partners could be a cost effective way for NewPower to 
help achieve our goal to be the branded choice of electricity in Texas  

We have developed some compelling ""Consumer Driven"" sign up incentives for 
Enron Employees such as ""Guaranteed Savings - Free December"" electricity, a 
aligned to a $20.00 NewPower ATM card and free companion airline ticket 
coupons. 
 
We would appreciate your help and support on the following:

Obtaining Enron Executive support/guidance for our proposed Enron Employee 
Exclusive offer for NewPower electricity. 
 - It would be helpful to have your personal endorsement linked to 
implementation assistance through Cindy Olson's HR group.
Guidance and support for a similar ""Customized"" offer to Enron's partners 
employees that might include Vincent & Elkins, Compaq, Arthur Andersen, 
Continental, University of Houston, University of Houston American Airlines.
   - We would appreciate any thoughts on other companies we should approach.
          - It would be helpful if you would consider sending  a letter or 
email of introduction to the companies CEO and head of Human Resources in the 
near future.
                  
To help you understand more about the proposed plan, attached, please find a 
copy of the plan highlights and draft creative that was sent by Nick Utton 
(Chief Marketing Officer) to Cindy Olson.  Nick is currently in discussions 
with Cindy on how to best implement this plan and has assigned Wilson Kriegel 
as the NewPower manager responsible for working through the details.  


I look forward to your input and help.  
This could go a long way in Texas towards our goal of NewPower being the 
national brand of ""Energy Solutions"".

Wilson Kriegel

The eGroups shows that you are listed as a member of the smu-betas group.
So you have been successful getting in the group.
To access the group should go to your web browser and type in
http://www.egroups.com

The screen should show that you are a member of smu-betas group. When you
replied to the original invitation, egroups may have asked for a login name
or password.  I'm not sure if it automatically signs you in or asks for you
to create a password.
You can simply click on the name ""smu-betas"" in the MyGroup section.
Otherwise, you can sign in by clicking on the ""sign-in"" hyperlink listed to
the left side of the screen in the MyGroups category.  It will prompt for
your email address.  If you already have the password set up, it will fill
it in automatically.

Give this a try. I think you should make it into the egroups. Let me know if
you still have problems getting in.
It you still have problems, you can also contact me directly at
shackleton@worldnet.att.net or craig_shackleton@amat.com
There are 53 members on the list now, including yourself, so the promised

Subject: UC/CSU Procedural Next Steps

As you know, UC/CSU sued us for breach of contract in March.  At the same 
time they moved for a preliminary injunction to restore them to direct access 
during the pendency of the case.  The district court granted their motion and 
issued the preliminary injunction.  We appealed the granting of a preliminary 
injunction in these circumstances, and, in addition, asked the Court of 
Appeals to stay the effect of the district court's order until our appeal 
could be heard.

The Court of Appeals granted our request for a stay.  Because of the 
similarity beween the legal tests for granting a stay and for granting of 
preliminary injunction, to grant the stay the Court of Appeals necessarily 
had to find, at least preliminarily, that the district court likely erred in 
granting the preliminary injunction.  This is why we think we will win our 
appeal, especially if it is heard by the same panel.  (Whether or not it is 
heard by the same panel depends on the clerk of the Court of Appeals and the 
schedules of the judges.)

We filed our brief in support of our appeal on May 14.  UC/CSU's and the AG's 
answering briefs must be filed by June 11.  Our reply brief is due 14 days 
after their briefs are filed.  The appeal is then referred to a 3-judge 
panel.  Oral argument is usually allowed.

If we win the appeal, UC/CSU campuses in PG&E and SCE territory remain on 
utililty service until a final decision is made in the case.   If we lose the 
appeal, we have to take them back until a final decision in made in the 
case.  The appeal relates only to the preliminary injunction.  The breach of 
contract action remains to be tried at the district court level.  

The contract expires March 31, 2002.  In the ordinary course a final decision 
in the case would not be made by then.  The judge, however, could expedite 
the proceedings so that a decision could be made earlier.  UC/CSU could also 
move for summary judgment, arguing that that facts are not in dispute and 
that the judge should rule without a trial.  In either event, it would seem 
unlikely that a final decision even on a expedited basis could be handed down 
before late fall/winter.

Please call me with any questions.  Thanks.

Following the success of our three previous annual conferences on the 
e-business and technology sector, the Economist Conferences is delighted to 
announce that we are now planning our fourth annual event Creating Value with 
Internet Technologies,  to take place in London in October of this year. We 
would very much like to invite you to deliver a keynote address at this event.

Now that spending on IT and systems is once again being evaluated in terms of 
productivity gains and returns on investment, companies are refocusing their 
efforts towards cost savings and efficiencies. As companies integrate the 
Internet into their supply chains, they frequently find that they need to 
change much more than their communications technology. Their strategy, their 
approach, their deployment of skilled people, their divisional structure - 
all these things get challenged.

We would very much like to hear your perspective on the potential for the 
e-marketplace, but, at this stage, I would also be happy to hear your 
suggestions.

The project is still in the early stages but we would like to secure our key 
speakers as early as possible. I am sure your diary will be very busy but we 
feel it would be of great value to have you there. Please find attached a 
draft outline of the event, and some further information about the Economist 
Conferences.
I do hope you will be able to consider our invitation, as your participation 
would certainly help to ensure that we offer an excellent programme and 
further add value to this annual gathering. If you have any further 
questions, please do not hesitate to contact me on one of the numbers below.  
I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Given the time difference involved I will not be able to contact him before

YPO is such a dynamic organization because of the quality and enthusiasm of
its members.
As Membership Chairman, I feel a profound responsibility to add new members
to further
that result.  To accomplish that, the Membership Committee needs the
attention and input
of all current members.

First, be on the lookout for any new potential members.  If you identify a
potentail candidate,
please contact my office (713-966-2602 or jeff_hines@hines.com).  Second,
and vitally
important, is to receive your comments, positive or negative, on candidates
who are
proceeding through the membership process.  Attached is the bio for
potential member
Carin Marcy Barth.

The Membership Committee seeks input on these candidates for a two-week
period
following the dissemination of their bios.  Again, please refer any input
to my office.
A several word comment as a reply to this e-mail is fine.  This timely
information is
critical to the process.  Remember, we need positive feedback (as well as
negative).
Many times prospective candidates have told us they know a lot of people in
YPO,
so when we do not hear positively about them it is concerning.  All input
shared with
the Membership Committee is held in Forum confidentiality.  If you have
input that you
feel that you only want to share with me please let me know.  Input
received after this
two-week period does not help the process.  Speak now or forever....you
know the rest!

Thanks for your input.

Sincerely,

Jeff Hines
Membership Chairman

I'm Glenn Krings with Sterling Software in Omaha, Nebraska and I recently
sent you a Priority mail envelope with a letter introducing e_CURE.  In
talking to your secretary, it apparently got lost in the shuffle, so I'm
sending it as an attachment via e-mail. e-CURE is an important new service
to help you reduce the costs of electronic data transmission or EDI.  It
further helps you to insure that the business rules in deregulated energy
markets are followed.

If you have any questions or if you need additional information about
e-CURE, please call me at 402-291-8300 x291 or e-mail
glenn.krings@sterling.com.

Have a nice day,
Glenn Krings

did!!!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
First-Day Employee

My father had a small business, employing approximately fifteen people at any 
given time.  We pasteurized and homogenized milk from farmers each morning, 
and put it into bottles for home use and for restaurants.  We also put the 
milk into small containers for the school kids everyday.  We also made a 
wonderful little thing called homemade ice cream.  We sold all of these milk 
products, and many more, in the front of a dairy building, which had been 
fashioned into a small store with a large soda fountain.  During the summer 
months, there were rows and rows of eager tourists lined up at the ice cream 
counter, waiting for their daily indulgence of my father's most exquisite 
recipes of some twenty-seven flavors of homemade wonder.

Being such an extremely busy little store meant that the employees had to 
work fast and furious for hours at a time, with little rest.  The swarm of 
tourists never stopped and our ""rush hour"" lasted many hours on hot days.

I had worked for my father since I was young, as did all seven kids in our 
family.  So I had seen many new employees come and go due to the fast and 
frenetic pace. One day, in 1967, we had a new employee, Debbie, who wanted to 
work in the store for the summer.  She had never done this type of work 
before, but planned to give it her all.

On her first day, Debbie made just about every mistake in the book.  She 
added the sales wrong on the cash register, she charged the wrong prices for 
items, she gave the wrong bag of food to the wrong customer, and she dropped 
and broke a half-gallon of milk.  The torture of watching her struggle was 
too much for me.  I went into my father's office and said, ""Please go out 
there and put her out of her misery.""  I expected him to walk right into the 
store and fire her on the spot.  Since my father's office was situated within 
view of the sales counter, he had no doubt seen what I was talking about. He 
sat, thoughtful, for a moment.  Then he got up from his desk and walked over 
to Debbie, who was standing behind the counter.

""Debbie,"" he said, as he put his hand gently on her shoulder.  ""I have been 
watching you all day, and I saw how you treated Mrs. Forbush.""

Debbie's face began to flush and tears began to well in her eyes as she 
struggled to remember Mrs. Forbush from the many women she had given the 
wrong change to or spilled milk on.

My father continued, ""I've never seen Mrs. Forbush be so polite to any one of 
my employees before.  You really knew how to handle her.  I am sure that she 
is going to want you to wait on her every time she comes in.  Keep up the 
good work.""

In return for being a wise and compassionate employer, my father got a loyal, 
and hardworking employee for sixteen years...and a friend for life.

Dear Dorothy:

Thank you very much for your note; below I have laid out the agenda for the
meeting for Ken and Jeff's approval:

1. Introduction to Adventis and our work in the Broad band space; - 20 minutes
2.  Ken's brief on Broad Band Services group's way forward: challenges,
issues, aspirations; - 15 minutes
3. Jeff's expectations and views form the corporate center;-10 minutes
4. Adventis' approach, likely routes to partnership;-10 minutes
5. Next steps: JEFF, KEN and our team.- 10/15 minutes

During the second hour with Ken, we wish to address specific points on the
out come of the first meeting to define areas of focus for path forward:

1 Strategic and operational issues for short term value creation, and
long-term robust development of BBS as global player
2. Acceleration capacity at BBS to capture short range opportunities versus
outside assistance.
3. Likely ways we could engage with Enron for both short term and long-term
wins.
4. Time line for creating the upside.

I am sure Ken and Jeff, will have a lot to add. Please do let me know.

Dorothy, given the significant challenges and opportunities ahead for Enron
BBS, we will have four of our senior most partners with deep insights into
Broad band and ASPs/CSPs join the meeting. I will come the night before, if
possible to have dinner with Jeff and/or Ken. Please do let me know the
possibility.

Dear?Mr. Jeffery  Skilling?
?
My name is  Scott Berta,?I along with my partners, have created some really 
wonderful  opportunities for companies and individuals to participate in 
company training  combined with corporate philanthropy that benefits our 
community. I will be  meeting with Mrs. Charla Reese and some of her team on 
Monday November, 20th at  2:30pm?(1400?Smith Street in Houston, Texas). We 
will be discussing  implementing these team philanthropic?events at Enron.
?
I know  that Enron is very committed to corporate giving and philanthropy. 
I?read  the wonderful write-up on you and what Enron has done during the MS 
150, in  Philanthropy in Texas magazine.? One of the events that my company  
offers is Bikes for the Little Tykes.? This is an event  that creates team 
awareness along with a powerful sense of giving. The  participates?give the 
bikes that they have put together as a team to  needy?children in their 
community.? Unbeknownst to the participates,  the children are brought into 
the event at the very end of the  program.?Team members are able to?see first 
hand what they  have?accomplished and?that they have really have made a 
difference in  a persons life.? We then go through a debrief session and try 
to help the  participants understand how their ""customers"", aka the children, 
made them feel  and how they can relate their experience to that of their 
daily  activities.
?
I know  this is short notice, but if you have time on Monday, I would really 
like to  meet you.?I look forward to meeting with you and sharing with you 
what my  company has helped other companies do for their communities and 
themselves.

the bottom line.  Our services span from Internationalization (both web
and software), technology (Webflow and ETS), professional services and
worldwide translation services, all developed and orchestrated to work
as a single, seamless effort.    Surely Enron handles alot of this already
but could the current process be made more cost effective as well
as expediting or increasing international revenue from foreign
markets?

SDL also offers ETS, a real time translation product that allows for
instant, multi lingual messaging, email, web based customer support,
etc... Product currently has a significant installed base of clients, in
particular, a joint effort between EDS and the FAA for global emails to
pilots and airports, as well as being used at Lucent as an internal
communications tool.    Again, this type of technology would be use
solely for content/info. one would not normally localize or translate.
ETS Webflow, which will further seperate us from the other static in the
Globalization industry.

I look forward to any suggestions you may have on how and with whom to
proceed further with. Thanks again for your time and have a great day.

Regards,

Michael

This sort narrowed the search considerably.  I'm having hard copies that I've 
organized by city (makes it quicker to look at) hand carried to you.  The 
1959 info should be coming in a couple of days.  If this approach doesn't 
find the person, I have another idea.

Thanks,

From previous notes, which I bcc'd to you, looks like I'm ""in business"".

I've really appreciated your two recent e-mails (as I have all of them).
Had gone to the Tribune web site (something I'd done before, in order to
show my friends here your picture, and brag a bit) looking for info on
percepctive section, but probably due to my bad searches didn't unearth it.
You explanation was very important.  Also important were your comments on
what struck you about what I've been writing.  Those kind of comments are
the best kind.  Often, when writing, its hard to know what works and what
doesn't work.

Perhaps the most important thing, however, is that the article will be
published by ""Tom Skilling's"" brother.  Though nothing's been published yet,
and I shouldn't write as if that's a certainty (afraid of bad luck), would
never had gotten close to this opportunity without you.  I'm very grateful.

Love you and looking forward to both of us experiencing how this ol'
newspaper media machine works (something with which I guess you are all to
familiar).

Wanted to drop a quick note to follow up on our conversation on Saturday. 

I am definitely interested in what the plan sounds like as modified. If you 
and I can find the right combination of tasks, it should work well; the 
matters you mentioned would all seem to fit into a split schedule. 

My schedule can be as flexible as needed, with the only restriction (a big 
one, I must admit) being that I would want to spend as much time in Istanbul 
as possible, both for Sukran and me. 

As we discussed, if you and I think there is a niche that would make sense 
for me, I could be in Houston for up to six months a year. Perhaps it would 
be helpful if we initially assumed that my schedule would include one month 
in Houston then one month in Istanbul, followed by two longer two-month 
periods in Houston and Istanbul.?This?schedule could be fragmented or even 
consolidated further, and of course there would have to a fair amount of 
playing it by ear. One thing I would be trying to do as things played out -- 
provided of course that none of my projects with you was put at risk -- would 
be to shave off a week here, a day or two there, so as to maximize my time in 
Istanbul.? I would do what was necessary to have myself well-wired into the 
States, and should be able to handle quite a few things effectively even from 
here. ??

As I mentioned, I have a lot going on here these next four or five months 
getting things set up with Sukran, but I could come to Houston for a month 
here, a month there, perhaps for the first time in approximately a month. 
After that, full-steam ahead. 

You might be wondering about my present work.?I would try to hold onto the 
newsletter, as that would continue to provide a great vehicle for my learning 
and writing about this place. Otherwise, my work here is not something we 
should worry to much about as we consider the above further. 

Yours with love,

Mark 

P.S.? Enjoy the festivities in Washington and say hey to Tom.

Does Montana meet the test? ? ? YUP!

In Southwest Montana snow capped peaks feed clear mountain lakes and streams. 
As these high mountain water sources merge in the lower valleys they foster 
more stunning scenery and create the Madison River ecosystem.

This magnificent watershed nurtures fish and wildlife habitat of unequaled 
splendor.

You are invited to join us at the 2000 YPO Montana Experience and indulge the 
outdoor adventure of your choice. Horseback rides into the Spanish Peaks, fly 
fishing on the Madison, white water float trips via the Bear Trap
Express and upland bird hunting at the Diamond Wing Hunting Reserve are but a 
few of the options available. Couple all this with real Montana hospitality 
reflective of a cultural heritage rooted firmly in the traditions of the Old 
West.

I hope all is well with you.

Sorry I missed you in NY a couple of weeks ago. I'd love to catch up with
you. Looks and sounds like you are still doing terrific things, and I use
you and Enron a great deal in conveying my message to investors and
managers.

Al Rappaport and I have completed our book, Expectations Investing, which
will be published by Harvard Business School Press in September. (See
attached preface). I'm really excited about the product, and I think you'll
find it interesting as well.

Al and I have asked the publisher to send you a more recent version for your
review. You'll probably get it in the next week or so.

Specifically, we'd be honored if you would endorse our book. The endorsers
we are targeting are a blue chip group, and we feel your perspective would
add a great deal.

Thanks in advance, and feel free to give me a shout if you have any
questions.

Michael

   OK, the deadline is fast approaching.  We're inside two minutes to play
and I need to know the game plan.  As of this day Oct. 2, here's what I have
confirmed in tickets ordered so that we all may sit together at this year's
homecoming game:
Mannino/1, Beek/1, Jordan/1, Artie/1, Wallace/1, Elvis/2, Grumbles/2,
Glass/3, Chuckles/1, J. Miller/2, Shack/1, Space/8 (he's bringing all of
Elzie's living relatives), Hutch/2, Fullerton/2, Coburn/2, Jansson/5 (he's
bringing all of Mom Pinchbeck's living relatives), Rossell/2, and Carl
Hohl/2 (he thinks...not sure because he never was).
    Now, if there are ANY OTHERS, you have about 48 hours because I need to
order these things when I get back in town on the 5th.  So if any of you
reading this want some, give me an email.  Also think about recruiting
others not on my email list that you think might not yet know about all
these plans.
     WE ARE ABSOLUTELY GOING TO ROCK THE NEW STADIUM.  I've already
contacted officer Caffey and he's given us yet another reprieve to behave
any damned way we want to, complete with SMU Secuity protection.

Shepard where the
Broadband equipment was being assembled.

I and a couple of others would like to visit it. This would be useful to us 
who are responsible for categorizing 
types of material and getting them in the SAP Material Master via the Aspect

Who can provide us the street address and allow us to visit?

Subject: corporate directorship




Greetings Jeff, 

I am contacting you to inquire as to your interest and availability for a 
potential corporate directorship. 

In particular, I'd like to speak to you for a moment about an potential 
directorship at a British company with annual revenue of $5.4 billion. It is 
the global leader in education publishing and also has considerable growing 
interests as a provider of financial information and other media. The board 
meets seven times a year - three times in London, three times in the US, and 
once elsewhere. I would be delighted to speak with you on this in further 
detail if it is of interest and send full information.

If this particular opportunity is outside your interests,? then I would like 
to take a moment to discuss what types of directorships you would prefer.

Please don't hesitate to contact me at 312-993-0754 or by e-mail. 

I appreciate your time and consideration and look forward to hearing from you 
soon. 

Best regards,

 Verliant, Inc.
  <<...>>
 Corporations today are confronted with a myriad of laws and
regulations from Federal, State and Local governments. Complying with these
regulations costs companies billions of dollars annually, in direct
compliance costs alone.   Furthermore, the risk of non-compliance is
significant and costs companies both directly, in terms of fines and
litigation, and indirectly in terms of increased insurance premiums.  OSHA,
which is only one of several compliance categories, estimates that companies
spend over $67 million annually--in fines alone.   Litigation and settlement
can cost multiples of the government fines.  Verliant has developed a
web-based, artificial intelligence tool that helps companies maintain
regulatory compliance and successfully manage operational risks. The initial
product focuses on compliance in environmental, health, safety and training.
The technology is developed and has completed a successful beta test with
its first client, Allied Waste Corporation. Contracts have been signed with
initial revenues to occur in January 2001.

 Technology & Product
  * U.S. employers face a multitude of onerous record
keeping and compliance responsibilities. The administrative burden of
maintaining up to date knowledge of, and complying with, regulatory
requirements is significant.
  * Verliant automates key management compliance
processes that were previously ignored or handled manually by employers' HR,
Safety or Legal departments.  Employers recognize significant cost savings
in compliance and substantial decreases in non-compliance.  Likewise,
productivity and the effectiveness of safety programs are enhanced.
  * Applications modules include: Human Resources
(Employee Record Management); Healthcare Compliance Auditing; Medical
Surveillance; Substance Abuse Program Tracking; Training, Evaluation and
Endorsement Tracking; DOT Driver Qualification File Maintenance; Event
Management; Accident and Injury Reporting, Tracking and Analysis; and
Industrial Hygiene.

 Market
  * There are over 6.5 million American firms that must
comply with regulatory standards.
  * OSHA estimates annual compliance costs at $33
billion.

 Marketing Strategy
  * Initial focus will be through direct sales to
Fortune 2000 companies.
  * Pricing is based on a monthly fee of about $2 per
employee.
  * Verliant has signed contracts with Allied Waste and
San-i-Pak.
  * The company plans to implement multi-tiered, direct
sales, distribution model supplemented by resellers with substantial
existing presence within niche target markets.  The company is negotiating
agreements with several resellers in both the medical and waste management
industries.

 Competition
  * Verliant has identified two direct competitors. The
first is Medgate, a privately held Canadian company that offers several
competing modules, but is not yet internet-based. The second is Complient,
which is in development of an internet-based compliance solution,
supplemented by training and safety product sales.
  * Other companies such as J.J. Keller, a privately
held company focused on the Department of Transportation (DOT) solution
only, is not internet-based.
  * A more distant competitor is PureSafety.com, which
focuses only on OSHA Training Tools.
  * Verliant is developing strategic relationships and
marketing alliances with several companies in the medical, waste management,
and PEO industries.

 Competitive Advantages
  * Management Team - The Company's executive management
skills, domain expertise, market knowledge, distribution channels,
intellectual property, and price versus performance are one of its greatest
strengths.
  * Superior Functionality - No competitors offer
Verliant's comprehensive suite of compliance rule-based solutions, on-line
document imaging, or full-service data entry and date loading.
  * ASP Delivery Model - The advantages of the ASP
include easy to use Internet based solutions, proprietary compliance rules
algorithms, and flexible reporting functions.
  * Brand Leadership - The Company's competitive
strategy will be based upon building brand awareness by virtue of its
expertise and the founder's reputation in the occupational health and safety
industry.

 Organizational Information
  Management Team
  * Pamela E. Harris, PhD, President and CEO - Founder

Subject: CERA's Mexico Energy in Transition Summit




Mr. Jeffrey K. Skilling 
President and COO 
Enron Corporation 

Dear Mr. Skilling: 

Building on the success of our special event held this past August in 
Houston, Cambridge Energy Research Associates (CERA) has created a new 
service, the ""Mexico Energy Advisory Service"". Designed to help facilitate 
the dialogue between the energy community and key government decision-makers, 
this service creates an open environment for members to exchange ideas with 
the country's energy policy makers regarding the future of the Mexican energy 
sector and the role of private investment.

To launch this new service, we will be hosting the inaugural Mexico Energy 
Summit on January 17, 2001 in Mexico City at the JW Marriott Hotel. This 
event will bring together senior executives from the energy community as well 
as key members of the new Mexican government in interactive sessions aimed at 
facilitating dialogue between the public and private sectors.

We invite you to consider participating in this first Summit, and becoming a 
member of the service. To view the agenda for the first Summit meeting, as 
well as a description of the scope, benefits, and deliverables of the 
service, please visit our website at: 
http://www20.cera.com/event/details/0,1324,CID1287,00.html 

The goal of the Mexico Energy Advisory Service is to help bridge the 
information gap that now exists in Mexico's energy sector. Through our 
interactions with the private sector, the state owned energy companies, the 
new administration, the Congress, and other interested parties, CERA will 
formulate objective and independent market analysis, and will monitor the 
progress and pitfalls of the energy reform process in Mexico.

To view the complete details of the service, please visit our website at: 
http://www20.cera.com/offerings/details/0,1504,CID1286,00.html 

To participate in the Summit, please complete and return the enrollment form 
found on our website. Please note that a portion of the Summit fee may be 
applied toward your first year's membership in the service. Should you have 
any questions about the Mexico Energy Advisory Service or the Summit meeting, 
please contact me or my colleague Lauren Laidlaw.? I can be reached directly 
at +1 617 498-9191 or e-mail to abullrich@cera.com.? Ms. Laidlaw can be

Hello --

A quick summary of key e-market/exchange progress over the past couple months:

1)  i2 network proposal submitted:  $20 million over a 36-month term -- U.S.,
Bussels, India.

2)  Financial Settlement Matrix launched:  120-day pilot -- EBS, i2, Citibank,
Wells Fargo, S1 Corp. --  EBS has 18% stake -- no significant revenue this 
year.

3)  i2 and IBM sponsoring EBS in MyAircraft.com (aircraft parts exchange) and
iStarExchange (Toyota private exchange):  rough estimate of initial network
business in these exchanges is $3 million annually (grows as exchanges grow) 
--
early discussion stage.

4)  i2 and Nortel sponsoring EBS in e2Open.com (high tech exchange with lots 
of
visibility, IBM is also a key player):  in early discussion stage.

5)  Ariba wishes to pull EBS into the Ariba Commerce Services Network (ACSN):
initial network proposal from EBS will include San Jose and London with Tokyo 
to
follow as soon as available -- rough estimate is $10 million over 36-month 
term
-- Ariba is also open to a proposal on hosting services from EBS.

6)  Lots of other business development in various stages, including Commerce
One, Oracle, Tivoli, BMC, and multiple exchanges and exchange technology
providers.

The good news is that the EBS pitch has been impressive to potential customers
and partners (see attached presentation for a sample).  We are pitching 
network
services successfully (the VBN product is key), but it is clear that the Enron
financial services skills are a major reason that customers are attracted to 
EBS
in this space -- through Mathis Conner and others in the Tech Channels Group,
EBS is gaining considerable skill in the value-added services arena (which is
where a lot of the future revenue resides).

Enron Net Works has been helpful to EBS' efforts in the exchange space.  Also
helpful are other EBS groups, such as those of Kevin Garland, Kevin Howard, 
and
Larry Lawyer.  As we become increasingly more visible in this space, we need 
to
think about how we want to unfold the story publicly.

I hope this update is useful.  Best regards.

Subject: Follow-up re: e-rehab



Just a quick update and follow up to my previous e-mail.

My colleague, Cory Christensen (another McKinsey alum), and I met with IBM
regarding a potential strategic relationship. That meeting went far better
than expected. A similar document to the one I sent to you has now reached a
number of their senior executives. Tom Bouchard, SVP of Human Resources, for
example, reacted by saying, ""They're (e-rehab) addressing a huge problem. I
would love to talk to them."" one of their senior healthcare VPs stated,
""This is exactly the kind of thing IBM would like to do. This is not the
only big thing we're looking at, but this is definitely big. It's right on!""
The table has turned. IBM is now pushing us with information requests and to
move the process along.

We told IBM that e-rehab is most interested in them as a customer, as is the
case with Enron and another half dozen blue-chip companies with which we
have initiated a dialogue. However, because IBM has come to recognize the
relevance and potential value we can deliver, they are now keenly interested
in becoming a minority investor (assuming that we clear their due diligence
screens).

The meeting with IBM last Friday was in Stamford Connecticut so I arranged a
meeting just prior to that with Steve Denning in Greenwich. Our visit was
meant to be purely social, but Steve reacted quite positively to our
business and would be interested in considering an investment by General
Atlantic Partners (GAP) if we sign up an IBM ... or one or more companies of
similar stature, such as Enron. Aside from GAP and our current investors, we
are not considering traditional funding sources. GAP is an exception because
of their potential non-monetary value-added.

In any case, the purpose of this note is to solicit a reaction to my earlier
e-mail. In other words, would Enron have an interest as a potential (early
adopter) customer and/or strategic investor? I would not have approached you
in the first place unless I was convinced that our services would be of
great benefit to Enron. If you have an interest in exploring this
opportunity, I'd like to determine and schedule next steps. I apologize. I
don't mean to be pushy, but I'm anxious and feel a great deal of urgency.

I'll place a call to your office next week to get a read on your
temperature. Look forward to getting a response.

Below is Bill's latest response, and the edit.  They made very few changes.
How about that.

It strange to think that right now, as I write this, you are on the set at
WGN, in the middle of the news program, perhaps putting a few finishing
touches on your graphics.

Just as I got up a few minutes ago (I got up early, which is the best time
to get through to the line I share [and also because I'm excited[), and at
the exact time I turned on the computor there was a flash of lightening
outside.  Then, moments later, just as a healthy downpour began, the muezzin
started singing outside.  (This is true, no lie.)  I thought to myself I
hope there aren't any more cosmic coincidences (such as a ..., well you
know).

I'll be on line for a bit, so maybe we'll be able to ""talk"" on this thing
almost as if in person.

Jeff,

After your call I thought I should give you some background on Datacentric 
Broadband (DCB). 

1. The company was founded by Leslie Anderson a woman entrepreneur in Conroe 
Texas.  Leslie continues to be the largest non institutional shareholder and 
is Chairman of the Board.  The president is Gary Remy, a Hispanic, whom you 
met recently at the YPO gathering. 

2. DCB is in the broadband wireless access market focusing on smaller cities 
in Texas.  They have deployed in nine different locations and have a strategy 
to grow from a regional player to a national player.  The market they are in 
requires no license fees and is one where being first to locate in a city is 
critical to success.

3. We have invested $2 million in DCB to date and brought in Redstone 
Investors who also invested $2 million. Redstone should continue to 
participate with us in any future investments we make in DCB.

4. We have talked to Kevin Garland  to solicit interest from him, however he 
made it clear that DCB was not in his target market and he was not interested 
in the investment.

5. DCB has engaged Arthur Andersen to help raise additional funds for 
continued growth.  We along with AA have been talking to other potential 
investors and have found a receptive yet cautious reception.

6. About two weeks ago we were approached by representatives of Union Pacific 
Railroad and Norfolk Southern Railroad with a proposal to invest up to $75 
million in DCB over the next five years beginning with an initial investment 
of $15 million.  U P asked if Enron would be willing to invest a similar 
amount alongside them to help DCB grow into a national broadband wireless 
access provider to smaller cities. After this request I asked Ken Rice if EBS 
would be interested in an investment in DCB either in conjunction with U P or 
on a stand alone basis.  My hope was that EBS would view DCB as a strategic 
fit to their business model and would be interested in a much closer 
relationship with DCB perhaps leading to a buyout. ( Although EBS and  DCB 
are in different businesses I know that the trading group of EBS has used DCB 
to provide liquidity and last mile access for many of their trades.)  Ken's 
response was that EBS was not interested in an investment in DCB and he 
didn't see a strategic fit between the two companies.  

7. We have also talked to Lou's group, the Xcelerator, and to LJM about 
investments in DCB and it appears that LJM is very interested in committing 
funds however I don't think they will be ready in time to match U P's 
commitment.

8.  At a subsequent meeting with U P we told them not to expect any 
additional funds from Enron other that a possible $2 to $3 million from 
ourselves since that is all of the capacity that we have left for this 
investment.  They are very disappointed that Enron does not see the strategic 
potential of this business the way they do, but nevertheless are still moving 
forward in their efforts to invest in DCB in the $75 million range.  We are 
currently in the due diligence process with U P and hope to wrap up a deal 
structure by the end of May.

  We have solicited the support of other Enron groups all along the way while 
making our investment decision.  I truly believe that DCB is in a space that 
could be very integral to the success of EBS and had hoped that we could work 
together more closely, however EBS does not see a strategic fit with DCB.  We 
will continue to develop relationships with other strategic and financial 
partners in order to enhance and grow the value of our investment in DCB.

 I will be happy to talk to you further about DCB and our investment.  We 
will of course seek your approval for any additional investments that we make 
in DCB.  Please call me if you have any additional questions.

Gene

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to 
Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this 
weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise 
$50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you 
consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...

Thanks again fro your thoughtful notes.

Can't say life normal, but in areas without damage not to far away from it.
Plenty of food.  No hoarding.  Delivery trucks seem to be bringing in normal
loads on a daily basis, just like before.  Of course, things will be taxed
by the demands of the rescue and restoration, but looks like the suffering
will be for those who were injured or who lost loved ones.  And what a lot
of suffering that will be.  Do have access to my building.  It is on solid
ground and is older, which in Turkey ironically means safer.  Still, spent
two of the last three nights sleeping outside, with millions of others.
Again, my buddy Ismail keeps coming through for me (Sukran too) and have
been able to enjoy his and his friends' company.  On these nights, every
open space not too close to a building seems to be filled with people
sleeping on blankets, jackets, etc.  Some have strung string between things
trees and other things you can tie string too and with sheets made
relatively cozy little spots for themselves.  It continues to amaze me how
kind and caring Turks are and how safe it is here (though I did hear of one
poor old fellow got his shoes stolen; perhaps he simply absent mindely
misplaced them).  Everyone, though, is tramatized, tired and sad.  And what
you read about impact on attempts to get economy, which has been hit hard by
Russian crisis, going unfortuantely appear right on the mark.  Wish Turkey
all the luck in the world.  It will need it.

Able to watch the local news, though obviously don't understand a lot of
what they're saying.  Still, the pictures tell enough.

More later.  Nice to know you're thinking about me.  Let dad and mom know
not taking any chances that weren't there already.

Love,

Mark

I have reviewed the information you sent regarding Simon Lee.   I was, in 
fact, aware of the memo sent by Sharon Butcher as I had requested that she 
detail the rationale for the decision.   While Sharon's decision is sound and 
logic based, it is ultimately a business decision.  I agree that if it is not 
illegal to provide remuneration to Simon that we should do so because it is 
not worth Enron's reputation in the market place to quibble over this issue.  
Moreover, based upon other issues that I have encountered as a result of 
promises made by the previous administration, I have no doubt that Simon was 
acting under the direction of individuals running the program.

The concern I would like for you to consider prior to making a decision about 
Simon Lee is whether Enron is prepared to offer the same remuneration to 
others who indicate that they are similarly situated.   I am not sure how 
many others may step forward but I have attached a copy of an e-mail from at 
least one individual who has a similar circumstance.  Ironically, this 
individual who was Simon Lee's roommate at Harvard chose to exercise his 
vested options.   He is now an Enron employee and is awaiting the outcome of 
Simon's situation.

In my opinion, these and other individuals like them should be treated 
consistently.  I do not advocate that we search for them but I would like to 
know that if the issue arises that it will not be necessary to expend time 
and energy on each individual case.  

Additionally, equally if not more important, is the issue of how this 
situation arose and what can be done to alleviate it in the future.   I would 
like to discuss at your convenience.

Thanks Charlene

Sam Malone would love for you to join him live at the Morning Show broadcast

between 7 and 8 am, but not at the top or bottom of the hour .  He wants the 
opportunity to banter with you on air about why Enron is the best place to 
work, Enron Field and what you have been doing lately.   It will be very 
informal, and depending on your schedule, he welcomes you to stay as long as 
you can.

Please let me know when you are available.

Subject: Enron Online Bid/Ask spread question

Hello Jeff, 

I submitted a  question that didn't get answered at the meeting.  I was 
hoping you could respond.  

We routinely see citizens of a country hold an ""inferior"" currency despite 
the presence of superior alternatives.  The incumbent currency has a smaller 
bid/ask spread, and a network externality  locks-in  the inferior currency.  
Volume creates lower spreads and lower spreads in turn attract more volume, 
conferring a monopoly status on the incumbent currency.

Do you think that Enron Online is taking advantage of a similar network 
externality?  How do our bid/ask spreads compare to the alternatives 
available to our competitors?  Do we stand willing to match our competitors 
bid/offer?

A final note:  I was curious to learn what you did to become so successful.  
Is there a place where your biography or resume is posted?  

Thanks in advance,

David Porter.

Hope you are doing well.  It has been quite a long time since we last spoke
when I was with Pathnet.  I have since started another company called Cogent
Communications and the company has been progressing very well in the last
year.

I'm in the process of putting together an Advisory Committee for the company
composed of industry, business, and political leaders.  I think your depth
of experience in telecom could add a lot of value to the company and am
looking to gauge your interest level in joining the committee.  The
commitment is limited to one meeting per year and you would receive stock in
the company.  Thus far we have commitments from Sergio Zyman of Coca Cola
and are in discussions with Bob Dole and Vernon Jordan.

Cogent is a facilities-based ISP offering very high bandwidth Internet
access to business users in the top tier cities in the US.  Utilizing the
latest in fiber-optic technology, we've built an all optical nationwide
network and are offering 100mbps non-oversubscribed service for a flat rate
of $1,000 per month.  Feel free to take a look at our website at
www.cogentco.com.  The company has raised over $350MM in financing to date
with investors including Oak Investment Partners, Broadview Capital, Texas
Pacific Group, Capital Research, and Worldview Technology Partners.

Please give me a call/email at your earliest convenience.  I look forward to
speaking with you and catching up.

Sincerely,

Dave Schaeffer, CEO

Subject: Meeting with FLAG

The following is a quick summary of last week discussions between FLAG, Ken 
Lay, Jeff Skilling and myself:

FLAG clearly wanted ECI to commit to some form of capacity or fiber 
purchase/deal on any or all of their planned expansions; the Pacific, 
Atlantic or to partner with them in obtaining European capacity.  We 
explained why obtaining fiber or major capacity on projects so far in the 
future was not of interest to us, unless we could do so on a capacity swap 
basis.  They indicated our U.S. network was not of value to them in such a 
deal, given that their customer base didn't need connectivity across the 
U.S., only to either of the coasts.  As for partnering in Europe, we each 
clearly have the ability to do it alone and I believe our U.S. assets are of 
adequate value to allow us to do it alone and may be of more value to 
potential swap partners than FLAG's existing capacity.
They are clearly focused on two objectives: 
 1.  portray a story of around the world connectivity to secure additional 
funding for further development.
 2.  develop additional entry points into their existing markets, in 
particular India, to fuel added demand for their capacity.
As for India, they said they have decided to develop a second landing point 
in Chennai, connected into Malaysia at a cost estimate of $100mm.  They want 
us to be their 50/50 partner and clearly value our in country expertise.  
They said they would like us to decide within the next month or they will 
proceed with Reliance to develop the second landing.

I think it comes down to this. There are a few ways we could do business with 
FLAG and here is my view of each of these:

1.  I would still like to do a capacity swap with them, but they are not 
interested in any of our existing assets and I am not interested in putting 
our capital into forward commitments against their project plans.  They 
clearly do not see the world the way we do and we are better off procuring 
capacity when we need it as prices continue to fall in the markets in which 
they now/will compete.  They have capacity between London/Mumbai/Tokyo now 
and prices will continue to fall.  They are adding capacity later this year 
between New York/London and we can always talk with them at that time, but I 
believe we can get the capacity we need by trading for it as we expand.

2.  We should not make any forward commitments on any of the 2001-2003 
developments as I think they may have financing problems in the future.

3.  We could co-develop the second landing in India in exchange for 
preferential rights to capacity into/out of India.  Sanjay we need to 
seriously discuss this, but if they are to be believed, they will proceed 
with this anyway.  If they do this without us, we will still benefit from 
additional capacity being made available into the market.  We have to weigh 
the benefit of preferential capacity rights against the risk of putting $50mm 
at risk into a project that is not core to our business.  I would like your 
thoughts on this.

Sanjay, let's discuss this on the next weekly conference call and decide how 
we want to respond to FLAG.  

Thanks, Steve

Subject: US Officials Dismiss Rumors Of Power Market Price Caps


  By Bryan Lee

  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Speculation that U.S. regulators would impose
price
caps on competitive power markets sent several sector stocks into a tumble
this
week.
  But officials with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the
U.S.
Department of Energy Tuesday called the speculation unfounded.
  ""We're not discussing (price controls),"" said FERC Commissioner Curtis
Hebert.
  ""This is the first I've heard of it,"" said FERC Commissioner William
Massey.
  ""I am not aware and have not been involved in any discussion related to
generic application of price caps,"" Massey said.
  A senior Energy Department official dismissed a rumor that Energy
Secretary
Bill Richardson had asked FERC to consider price caps as a response to
potential power grid outages this summer.
  ""We have not at all talked about price caps with FERC,"" the Energy
Department
official said, adding: ""We do not intend to get involved in that issue.""
  The comments came after shares of several companies active in the
converging
natural gas and power sectors took a severe hit Monday in response to
concerns
that the regulators would cap power prices, which would limit revenue from
gas-fired generation investments.
  Shares of Dynegy Inc. (DYN) dropped 8.6% on Monday, while Enron Corp.
(ENE)
and El Paso Energy Corp. (EPG) saw their stocks fall 4.9% and 5%. Calpine
Corp.
(CPN) took the hardest fall, losing 12% of its share value.
  Wall Street analysts attributed the sell-off to profit-taking and an
unfounded
reaction to speculation in a Prudential Securities note to investors
regarding
the potential for FERC to intervene in competitive power markets.
  The June article, written by Carol Coale, a Houston-based analyst with
Prudential, said FERC ""is proposing to endorse price caps on electricity to
prevent brownouts and other reliability issues.""
  Coale warned that this ""could significantly limit the profitability"" of
gas-fired generation investments by Dynegy, Enron, El Paso and Duke Energy
(DUK), which also saw share values tumble this week.
  These companies developing gas-fired power plants could see their
profitability affected ""if the FERC were to actually take such action,""
Coale
wrote.

  (MORE) DOW JONES NEWS  06-06-00
  03:24 PM- - 03 24 PM EDT 06-06-00
  ""My comments triggered a knee-jerk reaction,"" Coale said Tuesday.
  ""It's interesting to see how one small comment gets blown up,"" she said.
  Coale joined other analysts Tuesday in saying investors overreacted, and
suggested that Monday's sell-off might present a good opportunity to buy the
companies' stocks.
  ""We do not believe the government is interested in nationwide power price
caps,"" said James Yannello, an analyst with PaineWebber, in a note to
investors
Tuesday.
  ""We see the recent pullback...as an excellent buying opportunity,"" Yanello
said.
  Coale said the ground was laid for Monday's stock dive when Dynegy issued
a
press release Friday urging FERC ""to resist the temptation to endorse price
caps.""
  The possibility of price caps was raised by Dynegy and others in response
to
FERC's May 17 notice seeking comments on actions the regulators can take
this
summer to assure power grid reliability.
  While those comments urged the commission against considering price
controls,
the mere discussion of capping the steep spikes in power prices during
transmission grid constraints spooked investors Monday.
  Massey, the FERC commissioner, noted that the commission has never imposed
price caps on the competitive wholesale power markets its regulations helped
bring about.
  FERC has imposed price caps only in certain markets for ""ancillary
services,""
the term used for electricity generation necessary to assure grid
reliability,
Massey said.
  ""The price caps at the wholesale level are few and far between, and for
the
most part are very generous,"" Massey said.
  The grid-reliability measures FERC proposed May 17 would allow industrial
generators to sell power into the grid at prevailing market rates, or to get
paid for not using electricity, during a grid-reliability emergency, Massey
noted.
  Hebert, the lone Republican commissioner who has consistently voted
against
the FERC majority Democrats in allowing the price caps, said the stock
market's
reaction this week validates his arguments against price controls.
  ""Investors see their opportunity to earn being inhibited by FERC,"" Hebert
said. ""This is evidence of what I've been talking about. Price controls
consistently inhibit the market.""
  The stock performance of these companies will continue to be overshadowed
by
uncertainty until FERC announces its ""final decision"" on power grid
reliability, Coale said in a followup note to investors Tuesday.
  ""While we do not see a trend for the FERC to re-regulate the wholesale
electricity market, we do see a trend in its propensity to approve temporary
price caps in certain illiquid markets,"" Coale said.

>NEWS FLASH - World  Series Outcome On Hold !!!!!! 
?
NEW YORK (AP) --The New York Mets announced today that they are  going
to? court to get an additional inning added to the end of Game 5  ofthe
World Series.? The batting, pitching, and bench coaches for the  Mets
held a press conference earlier today.? They were joined by members  of
the Major League Players Union.? ""We meant to hit those pitches from  the
Yankee pitchers,"" said the Mets batting coach.? ""We were confused by  the
irregularities of the pitches we received and believe we have been  denied
our right to hit.""
?
One claim specifically noted that a small percentage of the Mets  batters
had intended to swing at fast balls, but actually swung at curve  balls.? It
was clear that these batters never intended to swing at curve  balls, though
a much higher percentage were not confused by the  pitches.? Reporters at
the press conference pointed out that the Mets  had extensively reviewed
film of the Yankees pitchers prior to the World  Series and had infact faced
the Yankees in inter-league play earlier in the  year.? ""The fact remains
that some of the pitches confused us and denied  us of our right to hit,""
said the Mets batting coach. ""The World Series is  not over yet and the
Yankees are celebrating prematurely.""
?
Major League Baseball has reviewed the telecast of all the World  Series
games and recounted the balls and strikes called by the umpires of  each
game.? ""While some of the strikes called against the Mets were, in  fact,
balls, there were not enough of them to change the outcome of the  World
series,"" the commissioner said.
?
Another portion of the Mets legal claim stated that, based on  on-base
percentage, the Mets had actually won the World Series, regardlessof  the
final scores of the games.? ""It's clear that we were slightly  on-base
more often than the Yankees,"" said a Mets spokesman.? ""The World  Series
crown is rightly ours.""? The manager of the Mets has remained in  relative
seclusion, engaging in some light jogging for exercise.? He has  stated
that he believes ""we need to let the process run its course without  
rush to judgment.""

Through several forwardings of memos it has come to my attention that you had 
several meetings this week with Sharad Pawar and reached some agreements.  I 
understand that a conference call to generate a strategy regarding our 
approach to Mr Pawar was cancelled and no one is able to explain to me what 
approach  you took or what the nature is of any agreements or accomodations 
that you may have struck in these meetings.  I think it is important that I 
and the rest of the task force be involved in the setting of strategy even if 
we will call on you to conduct any of the discussions and it is clear that it 
is cooperation and coordination is paramount.

Please call or write immediately with a briefing of those meetings and of any 
agreements that were agreed to.  In the future, I would appreciate better 
coordination and discussions on all matter related to Dabhol and to Metgas.  
I am available by phone day or night.

afternoon during the 5 p.m. show to talk about how successful companies 
recruit college graduates.  Ray Suarez will be the substitute anchor for Jim 
Lehrer.  The recruiting segment, for which you are one of four panelists, 
will run approximately 12 to 14 minutes, probably in the first half of the 
one-hour show.  The other panelists are:

 Marilyn Mackes, executive director of the National Association of Colleges 
and Employers (Philadelphia)
 Ken Ramberg, CEO and co-founder of Jobtrack.com, the portal most 
universities use to post jobs for students and graduates (Los Angeles)
 Bill Carson, director of career services for Morgan State University 
(Baltimore)

There will be a three-minute background piece filmed at a recent college 
graduation in Portland that will air prior to the roundtable discussion.  
Once that airs, the anchor will ask questions of each of the panelists and 
start a discussion that will generally follow the format of the pre-interview 
you did on Wednesday.  Don't worry about keeping your comments short.  The 
show wants to encourage an in-depth discussion about recruiting.   If another 
panelist makes a comment that you agree or disagree with, feel free to jump 
in and add your opinion.

We will be set up in the Board room, and the show has asked that you be ready 
by 4:45 p.m.  The show airs live at 5 p.m., and the segment should air in the 
first half of the show. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.

exchange:
Officer:
May I see your driver's  license?
Driver:
I don't have one. I had it suspended when I got my  5th DUI.
Officer:
May I see the owner's card for this  vehicle?
Driver:
It's not my car. I stole it.
Officer:
The  car is stolen?
Driver:
That's right. But come to think of it, I think  I saw the owner's card
in the glove box when I was putting my gun in  there.
Officer:
There's a gun in the glove box?
Driver:
Yes  sir. That's where I put it after I shot and killed the woman who
owns this  car and stuffed her in the trunk.
Officer:
There's a BODY in the  TRUNK?!?!?
Driver:
Yes, sir.
Hearing this, the officer  immediately called his captain. The car was
quickly surrounded by police, and  the captain approached the driver
to handle the tense  situation:
Captain:
Sir, can I see your  license?
Driver:
Sure. Here it is.
It was  valid.
Captain:
Who's car is this?
Driver:
It's mine,  officer. Here's the owner' card.
The driver owned the  car.
Captain:
Could you slowly open your glove box so I can see if  there's a gun 
in it?
Driver:
Yes, sir, but there's no gun in it.
Sure  enough, there was nothing in the glove box.
Captain:
Would you mind  opening your trunk? I was told you said there's body in it.
Driver:
No  problem.
Trunk is opened; no body.
Captain:
I don't understand  it. The officer who stopped you said you told him you
didn't have a license,  stole the car, had a gun in the glove box, and that
there was a dead body in  the trunk.

and one this morning, and saw little eveidence of damage.
Saw on CNN that americans say quake 7.8  Unbelievable.

My lap top running out of battery, so will just refer you to the below,
which was my reponse to my a note from my brother several hours ago.

        * * *

Just got on line.  Surprised it was possible.  Electricity out, so probably
only us with battery powered lap tops clogging things up.

Everything ok here, so far.  Got a pretty good shake.  Was out in the
streets for a couple of hours, with everyone else.  My neighborhood up on
solid rock, so things looked mostly ok.  Lots of old and bad construction
here; many stones in the street.  One upper floor (abandoned) apartment half
a block from here collapsed and much debris in the stereets.  No apparent
injuries, however, in my neighborhood.  Unfortunately, other areas not so
lucky.  Saw 6.7 estimate for Izmit, the center, here (one place I passed had
a generator and had a tv out for everyone to see).  Passed women praying,
men reading Koran, most just huddled in groups talking. Strange being in the
middle of it all with limited ability to communicate.  Know a few folks in
neighborhood and we had a few basic chats, though its amazing how much I
learned even from them.  Already knew the Turkish word for earthquake, which
is depram (revolution is devrim) and came in handy.

A few seagulls just went by and I think a neighbor down stairs shut a door;
mistook that commotion for an aftershock.  A little rattled myself; much
like after SF quake.  I think memory of that still deep seeded in my
subconscious.

Again, this new technology amazes.  Better get off and save my battery.  May
need it.

Thanks for the note.  It was good to see your messages there.  I'll send
this to the rest of the family, but if they call tell them I'm ok and
worried about them worrying about me.

Love,

Mark

to join the committee. 

In terms of an action plan:
Once we have finalized the committee members, I will schedule a meeting 
(preferably before the Febr. 1 scheduled news conference) with all members to 
offer them an opportunity to meet one another and discuss how we will proceed.
Next, I will begin scheduling meetings with some key people that  would 
provide the committee with important insight into the key issues facing the 
HFD. Jeff suggested possibly blocking out an entire day where the committee 
members would speak to these individuals back to back in 1 or 2 hour time 
slots.
Then, a full day will be blocked out where the committee members will 
interview the approximate 10 identified candidates.
The committee will then meet (half a day?) to narrow the list of 10 down to 3.
The three final candidates will be presented to the Mayor.

Probably the best thing is for the call to go ahead, that way Jerry can
brief Mr. Skilling on our plans for the remaining dinners throughout the

Does that sound feasible to you?

Subject: Stanford/McKinsey survey invitation letter

Jeff and Sherri,

As Jeff and I descussed briefly on the Dallas trip, Enron is involved ina 
5-yr research relationship sponsored by Stanford, in conjunction with 
McKinsey entitled ""GLOBE""--it's looking at how Global companies manage 
themselves, internal communication networks, etc.

Part of the yearly plan is to conduct an emplyee survey of approximately 100 
""global"" employees. I've taken the survey myself--it takes less than 15 
minutes--it's very easy and doesn't require revealing anything sensitive we'd 
be concerned about. Clicking on the invitation letter will provide a direct 
link to the survey, so please feel free to review the survey itself, or even 
take it.

We can best benefit from the data gathered if we get a good return on our 
survey.  We're likely to have the best chance of a good return if the 
invitation letter to participate comes from Jeff.

Would you please read the attached letter? If you give it your consent and 
approval, we can arrange to have the survey sent from Jeff's mailbox.



Please let me know--thanks!!

--Christie.

Hi Christie !!
 
  Please send me the survey invitation letter.  Also, I will send you a copy 
of the random list of respondents for your review tonight.  As I mentioned to 
Gerry, the survey is already developed and hosted by the Stanford/McKinsey 
group; therefore, there is no additional development work required.  
Typically, I would use our in-house survey tool, confirmit, to build and 
deploy surveys.  This is a special case where the survey link is already in 
place.  My specific deliverable for you would include the list of 100 random 
individuals and a mechanism for the deployment.  The same manner in which 
Gerry and I received the survey can be used for the 100 random individuals.  
That is, simply mailing the survey link along with the invitation letter to 
each individual via Lotus Notes.  This is not a typical function of my area; 
however, I am glad to lend assistance in this case.  

In the future, should you require a survey built from ""scratch"" 
(so-to-speak), I will be able to assist you in that process.  Thank you for 
your patience.

Regards,
Milton

with as a fire officer in the past 10 years.

2. State whether the fire department has any employee group, association
or union that is recognized as the bargaining agent for the department.
If so, please describe your working relationship with that organization.

3. Does the department where you presently work have any type of state or
local civil service?  If so, explain.

Hi Jeff,
Don't know if you remember me from your old McKinsey days, but I am Richard
Saettone's wife. The entire family is finally back in Houston after several
years in Peru.  I am working for a company called Home-Link Services, and
wanted to request your aid in finding the correct person to talk to at Enron
regarding our business model.

We currently represent over 200,000 transactions per year (people moving),
and one of the most requested services from our customers is the connection
of utilities.  As an aggregator for the energy sector with that type of
volume, who do you recommend we call?  We are expected to grow to about
500,000 transactions by year-end.

Feel free to call me with any questions.  I would be most happy to send you
or the proper Enron contact an executive summary for review.

Richard sends his regards and we hope your family is doing well.

Hello Jeff

A voice from the past.  Hope you are doing well.

I wanted to gain your assistance to point me to the most appropriate person
I could interview at Enron.  I am helping a client understand how companies
in the US Natural Gas and Power industry are coping with the challenges in
their industry in terms of developing and retaining the ""right skills"".
So, someone who could provide an external perspective of how players in the
industry are coping with the challenges as well as an internal perspective
on Enron would be great for me to interview.  If that means more than one
individual, that is fine too.

Hope this is not too much of an imposition.  I'll undertake the
conversation over the telephone and keep it short.

You can reach me on email: sgiridha@prismintl.com or on my cell phone:
240-603-6084.

Thanks a lot for your assistance.

I have attached for your review the following documents related to InterFit
Health.com:

1. InterFit Health Business Plan Summary.
2. Investor list from our recent offering.
3. Investor letter concerning Sept. and Oct activities.

The current  shareholders are composed of Founders 61%, Mischer Healthcare
Services 17%, Round I investors 21%. I personally purchased 14% of Round I.
The investors purchased a convertible preferred and the company may not
incur debt without consent of the preferred holders so it is in effect a
first lien.

The company is initially focused on health screening through blood testing
but I anticipate adding other product lines such as radiology next. The
vision is to become a corporate and consumer full service diagnostic site
with medical records storage along with referral capability to healthcare
providers in major urban markets.

There are several characteristics that interested me in InterFit:

1. Empowering consumers and corporations to take controol of healthcare
management.

2. The confluence of aging baby boomer demographics and their requirements
of diagnostic testing.

3. Application of technology to enable the company's clients to access lower
pricing at their convenience vs the physicians schedule.

4. The rapid growth rate of gene based testing. Quest Diagnostics performs
six million gene based test annually with a current growth rate       of 50%
per year.

5. To date there are no direct competitors taking the integrated approach to
diagnostic services.

If you have a interest in investing we would be pleased to have you as a
shareholder. The average investment per holder in round I was $75,000. We
will have a second round closing in June 01.

Enron has used InterFit to provide health screening several times between
1995 and 1999. As we discussed my view is that corporatioons have always
approached screening as a employee benefit but never were given a integrated
solution. My approach is to provide the employee/dependants diagnostic
services, a referral solution for out of range results and storage of
historical medical records. The corporation will receive a generic data base
mapping the health of their employees which can be used to predict disease
and truly risk measure the population. Obviously this will be very useful in
negotiating managed care provider contracts on your actual data versus
getting dumped into their huge data base.

InterFit will be able to address the North American market at launch in
January 2001. The answer to your question regarding England/Europe and South
America is that we need to set up laboratory networks and provider networks
but it can be done.

In closing, I believe Enron would benefit significantly from participating
in our program but it will require senior management committment to a long
term program to reap the benefit of healthcare cost containment.

Thank you for your interest and I will look forward to hearing your
thoughts.

Sincerely,

Walt

Jeff,


I'd like to introduce you to?our company?and set-up a?one-hourconference
call?and discussion with you?and/or?someone you?trustto evaluate?this
opportunity.

iSpheres Corporationisco-founded by the Chairman of  Computer Science
Department at California Institute of Technology.

iSpheres enables dynamic arbitrage opportunities in commodities  trading.
With iSpheres, trading firms wrap applications like steel  marketplaces,
energy marketplaces, demand planning systems, and production  planning
systems as components, and derive additional business value by  monitoring
these components for real time interdependent events and then  reacting to
those?composite events  based on business rules.

iSpheres provides a software framework for developing and deploying these
loosely-coupled Web Services or Meta-Applications. These applications are
assembled from multiple components, each of which was previously itself an
application and data source, to enable new business processes.



For example, a $22 billion investment bank uses the iSpheres Meta
Application Framework,?to  detect and react to interdependent market
events. This enables them to optimize  and automate the acquisition and
response to relevant dynamic?events in  their Market Intelligence
information environment.

The build out of the Internet and the rapid  deployment of eBusiness
applications over last several years has established the  need and created
the ability to build and deploy loosely-coupled Web Services or  Meta
Applications.

Please advise, otherwise I'll  follow up with you in 3-5 days.

This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=

directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=

has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=

redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=

opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=

Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=

markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=

(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=

international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=

positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=

for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=

will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20

broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=

the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=

Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=

Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=

EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=

the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=

der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20

at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=

commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=

newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=

I'm contacting you to let you know of an exciting opportunity to speak
at the Spring 2001 InformationWeek Conference to be held April 1-4,
2001, at the Ritz Carlton in Amelia Island, Florida.

Each year, the editors of InformationWeek choose a theme for the
conference that brings to life our editorial point of view -- the very
reflection of developments and trends in business and IT.  This year
our theme is: ""Radical Simplicity: The Drive to Conquer
Complexity and Enhance Customer Value."" E-business has
revolutionized the global economy. But it's also built complexity
directly into the very technologies that were intended to facilitate
business among companies and their customers and suppliers. As the
technologies designed to link more partners became more complex, so
too did the business processes for which they were used.  This
Conference will highlight the drive toward simplicity ? in technology,
in business models, in business processes, in corporate culture, in the
economy. And in the very way companies interact with their
customers.

Based on the role you and your enterprise are playing in your industry
segment and from our recent coverage of Enron, we know that this
fundamental concept, driven by technology, is helping your
organization redefine itself to build better customer relationships and
face new competitors in today's fast-changing economy.  As such,
we'd like to invite you to speak in a session at this Conference.

Our semi-annual InformationWeek Conference is a unique blend of
professional development, research, and peer-to-peer networking. If
you're able to participate, you'll be joined by close to 500 other senior
IT and business executives, in addition to other industry experts. With
your contributions and those of your peers, The InformationWeek
Conference truly is like a special issue of the magazine come alive!

We hope that you'll be able to attend. I, or one of my colleagues, will
be calling to discuss this speaking opportunity with you in the next
week.  Best wishes and we look forward to speaking with you.

Subject: Online Foreign Exchange

Jeff:

I am taking the liberty of writing this note to you regarding a tremendous 
potential business opportunity that has to do with trading of Foreign 
Exchange Online . The idea is to bring the clients and the banks together 
where  the banks can bid to buy or sell when business clients wants to buy or 
sell certain currency. My understanding is that the total foreign exchange 
turnover per day is in several trillion dollar range.  Currently, I am 
working in Santa Cruz, Bolivia as President/General Manager of Bolivian 
portion of Bolivia to Brazil pipeline and may not be up to speed on Enron's 
activities in this area.   If we are already doing this, please disregard 
this note and accept my appologies for taking your time and, if we are not 
doing this, here is my two cents worth and let me know if I can do anything 
to implement it. 

I would also like to take this opportunity to thank you for your leadership 
in making this such a great company. I have been with the company for last 
twenty years and it has been a phenomenal experience. The best part is that 
we have just  began.  I am very excited about  the future growth 
opportunities of  EBS and am looking forward to contributing in that area one 
of these days.

Sherri - Let me have Jeff's preferred September dates and I'll make sure we 
get one of them fixed.

It would be helpful if Jeff could give me a sound bite to headline his 
discussion for the group.  One obvious area of interest is how Enron has 
transformed itself over the last ten years to the P/E ratio of 50+ we see 
today.  Another area of interest would be Enron's perspective of free 
markets, regulators and California.  Please let me know Jeff's preference.

Subject: UK CEOs

Jeff,

As you may recall from our discussion on your visit to London last summer, 
one of the challenges we have in Europe is raising the external profile of 
Enron.  To help address this, I recently replaced Ralph in a group of UK CEOs 
which meet monthly, so I can continue to raise awareness of Enron's 
businesses and generally network.   At each lunch meeting which lasts around 
two hours, one of the CEOs makes an informal 20 minute speech on a current 
business subject of their choice and then a discussion follows.

The group has asked if you would like to chair the meeting in September 2001 
on a date of your choice.  At the end of this note there is a list of the 
current membership.  I have been to one meeting and only around a third 
attended.

Please let me know if you are able to commit time to this.  There is no 
problem if you decline.

either want to add someone to the PRC Committee or who want to have someone 
attend the Associate and/or Analyst PRC meetings because they do not have a 
representative on the Committees.  

Unfortunately, it is not possible to add additional PRC Reps at this time 
because all of the Associates and Analysts have been divided between the 
existing PRC Reps.  Additionally, as you are aware, the PRC meetings are next 
week, December 12th & 13th and there is not enough time to gather 
information.  We will, however, be reducing the number of Associates and 
Analysts that each PRC Rep is representing and will need several additional 
Reps. If you have individuals that should be nominated please send the names 
to Terry Bosien.  The parameters that were used for the initial appointments 
were as follows:

The person must be a well-respected individual who is nominated/approved by 
the Office of the Chair of the Operating Company
The Associate PRC Reps are vice presidents
The Analyst PRC Reps are directors /sr. directors

The level of the PRC reps on the committee is important to adhere to for 
several reasons.  First, Jeff wanted individuals at these levels to gain 
additional exposure in the organization and be involved in activities beyond 
their business unit boundaries.  Additionally, it potentially places the PRC 
Rep in an awkward position and they may feel undue pressure in the meeting if 
they are required to disagree with a more senior individual.  

We have also received request from individuals wanting to ""observe"" the 
meeting.  As in the MD/VP process, individuals are not allowed to just 
observe if they are not a part of the Committee.  We attempted to have the 
major units represented, however, it is not possible to have every division 
represented.   Jeff Skilling spent over an hour with the PRC Reps explaining 
why the individuals selected as PRC Reps, rather than the Associates' & 
Analysts' managers, should be the ones to represent the Associates & Analysts 
in the PRC.  He also reiterated the importance of the PRC Reps' 
responsibilities which was to (1) meet with the Associates' and Analysts' 
managers;  (2) gather as much information as possible and (3) advocate 
objectively for the individual.
Also, if there are too many individuals in the room it is difficult or 
impossible to come to a consensus, which has been the case in the past.  

I hope this is helpful.  If business units find this is not acceptable, they 
should seek approval for their attendance from Jeff Skilling.

Thanks for your understanding, cooperation and support.

Charlene

quickly metamorphisized into something close to autobiography.  Some of
the original atmospherics have lingered, and don't necessarily reflect
anything about yours truly.  Later.

At The Galata Tower Cafe

Cigarette smoke, ignoring the lazy sweep of an old ceiling fan, hangs in
the air above me.  It seems to mock my obsessive, rambling thoughts
about teaching and writing and learning Turkish and, of course, HER.
""Take it easy"", it says with a smirk.  ""Relax.""  A phony look of concern
clouds it further.  ""What about taking a deep breath?""  Surreptitiously
(I think), I take in the recommended breath, but the smoke has drifted
in closer, notices.  ""There!  Isn't that better?""

""No"", I say to myself.  (Don't worry, I am not so far gone as to take
this internal dialogue thing outside.)  I flick my hand through one
particularly annoying cloud of the stuff.  ""Now get lost!""

Outside, at the base of the ancient Galata Tower, kids on their way home
from school set off an M-80.  I flinch at the explosion, which is
amplified by the tight dimensions of the square and the old stone walls
surrounding it.  The square itself, left in a premature dusk by the huge
tower's shadow, is temporarily emptied of the teenaged mob.  I stare out
the window into the gloom.  Though only the bottom few meters yards of
the tower are visible to me, I am aware of its tremendous bulk.  The
tower, first built by the Genoese in the 1300's, dominates my entire
neighborhood, the Kuledibi.  It should remind us all, I suppose, of the
durability of stone and dirt, and of the significantly less impressive
characteristics of flesh and blood.  Day and night (amused, perhaps, by
the slim activity of this generation's version of flesh and blood?), it
stands obdurate, unmoved, like the leg of a giant one dare not disturb.

Emboldened by the lack of any official response to the bombing,
one-by-one the would be terrorists (or freedom fighters; who's to say?)
drift back into the square.  I suspect the tower isn't nearly half as
bothered by these kid's budding pyromania as me, since it has no doubt
been subject to much more serious attacks during its 700 or so year
history.  Seeing that no adult has stormed into the square to
re-establish order, I brace myself for another blast.  Maybe I'm the
only one who really minds.  Every male in this country does have to
serve in the army for eighteen months.  Perhaps the noise doesn't bother
them, or maybe they see that this rather serious version of child's play
has a practical side to it, giving the kids a head start on basic
training.

I am surprised to discover that the waiter, Yusuf, is standing next to
me. He has his head thrown back slightly, a gesture that has become, for
my benefit, his version of the question ""More tea?""  (He has given up on
words, as the ones he knows still don't much match the ones I know.)

""Evet, cay lutfen.  Bir az sutlu, lutfen. [Yes, tea please.  With a
little milk, please.]""  (Never would have guessed that, huh.  And yes, I
agree  [and have been told before] too many ""lutfens"".  There are
probably other mistakes too, but my words seem to get the job done.
I'll work on perfecting them, ""sonra [later]"".)

 Yusuf nods, walks away.

I realize I have my head bent forward, a subconscious adjustment I must
have made to dodge some of the smoke.  I see a cat under one of the
tables looking up at me.  It opens its mouth for what I figure is the
beginning of a yawn.  But, instead, it emits a strange, high-pitched
wail, sounding more like a bird than a cat.  Embarrassed for the poor
thing, I look away.

For maybe the first time since I have been coming to this cafe, I take a
close look around.  (I must be getting more comfortable. ""Dikkat! [Watch
out!]"")  There are very few other people in the cafe, which is
surprising, given the amount of smoke.  They are all sitting alone,
their heads, like mine, bent forward.  I suspect that boredom, however
-- and not the smoke -- is the proximate cause.

Every table is covered with green felt table clothes, all of which are
seriously spotted with tea stains and cigarette burns.  In the middle of
each table, looking like a tiny shrunken crown, is a silver ashtray.

Above the kitchen, which is squeezed unnecessarily tight into a corner
of the otherwise spacious caf?, hangs a huge painting of a beach scene
from somewhere in the Pacific.  Once no doubt bright and evocative, it
has aged and has now almost completely blended into and disappeared
amongst the dull wood panels covering the top half of the room.  The
green of the palm trees lining the beach is now so dark it is
approaching black.  The sand, probably once pure white, is the color of
the mud in the streets outside and the sea close to the color of the tea
served here. There are several boats pictured, all pulled up onto the
sand, but they are now no more than ghosts and, indeed, look as if
someone may have tried to erase them.  The painting is as changed and
distorted as the dreams of those who sit below it absent-mindedly
stirring their tea, their feet crammed into shoes stiff from having
walked through too much winter rain, their fingernails having long ago
surrendered to the dirt now permanently built up under them, wearing
clothes that didn't smell so bad this morning they couldn't be worn just
one more day, drinking the cheap tea they can scarcely afford, dreaming
perhaps of little more than an early spring.

I sit up in my chair, let my head fall back, take in a deep breath and,
surprisingly, begin to relax.

David, 

Many thanks for agreeing to speak at our YPO session on April 24, 2001, in 
Houston.? The meeting will be held at Enron Broadband Services' network 
equipment staging building, which is close to downtown.? We anticipate 
attendance of about 100 people. 

Breakfast will begin at 7:30 a.m., and the program will run from 8:15 a.m. 
to 10:15 a.m.? The subject is ""New Trends in Technology and Venture 
Capital.""? You will be on a panel discussion with two other venture 
capitalists.? I expect the tone will be highly informal, but I will 
schedule a conference call (probably in early March) to provide more 
details and specific topics of interest. 

Again, David, thank you.? I look forward to seeing you in April. 

Jeff

Jeff, 

I will be heading out to Macerich's offices to meet Macerich's management 
team. At that meeting, we will be discussing the outsource and the future 
relationship between the companies.  He would also like me to speak to his 
direct reports about change management and other cultural characteristics of 
Enron.  However, he would really like you to provide a presentation on the 
same general topics to the Macerich Company Conference in June.  He has heard 
you speak and believes your approach and perspective can benefit the 
conference.

Obviously, these guys are an important relationship and reference for our 
commercial and real estate business.

Let me know your interest.

Regards
Delainey

Subject: Macerich Conferences


Angela - thanks for making time to have dinner with us on Wednesday:  it
was great to see you.

As Art mentioned, since the time we have started working with you, we have
made frequent references to our operating teams about Enron's
accomplishments in the areas of customer excellence and employee
satisfaction.  More generally, we've held Enron out as an example of a
highly accomplished company in all the areas Macerich is currently focusing
on as an organization (operational integration, customer orientation,
scalability, change leadership, and strategic focus).

All of that being said, we would be extremely appreciative of an
opportunity to have either Jeff Skilling or Dave Delainey speak at either
of these conferences.  In any event, we're delighted that you would make an
effort to see if this can be put together.

Relative to upcoming Macerich events, there are two scheduled:

(1) University of Notre Dame Executive Education Program, May 7 - 9 in
South Bend.  The curriculum is centered on change leadership and strategic
thinking (officially ""Enhanced Leadership and Strategy in the New
Economy"").  Attendees include our Executive Team (Art, David, Rick,Tom, Ed,
and Larry Sidwell) and our Operating Team (17 SVPs).  There is also a
round-table discussion scheduled with our Board on May 9.

(2) Macerich's Company Conference, June 4 - 7 in Park Cities, Utah.  The
emphasis of the conference will be on our ""e-Business Transformation"" (more
specifically on becoming wholly integrated across functional roles,
customer facing, and highly scalable) and capturing value in our ""Value
Network"" (relationships we have with retailers, partners, vendors,
shoppers, etc.)  The attendees for this event include the same people at
UND as well as our managerial professionals from the malls and our
corporate offices (about 250 people, total).

Let me know if you need any additional background or information.

Eric

Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this 
weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise 
$50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you 
consider helping him reach his goal?

West is best, I guess, (and apparently now more ethnically mixed?)

Trip to Washington sounds great.  Once when I was there, maybe 5 or 6 years
ago, I had the opportunity to visit a congresswomen's office, as I knew an
intern there.  Was, among other things, escorted to the Capital
building(through tunnels that lead under the Mall from the various office
buildings to the Capital building) where I saw a few hours of a
Congressional debate on one of the many campaign reform bills that have
passed through those (not so hallowed?) halls.  The debate very interesting,
not the least reason being that it was made before only a couple dozen of
the 500 or so congresspeople (the rest, I was told, were monitoring the
debate on TVs in their offices).  At the few times that a quorum of the
members actually have to be present (for, say, an impeachment vote), a bell
rings and congresspeople hustle through the above mentioned tunnels to
register their vote, after which they hustle back.  It's something to see.
Good luck with the application.

YOU MUST, while in DC, see the Holocaust Museum.  I Mean MUST.  Should make
reservation (probably can use the Internet), as I understand it's booked up
far in advance.  The museum's right off the Mall so is conveniently located.
  The most powerful museum I've ever been too.

Turkish course finishes in two weeks.  Then to Israel during first week of
April, to Italy during second week.

Bursa was very impressive.  Not nearly as dilapidated as (most of) Istanbul.
  Was the first capital of the Ottoman Empire, so there are important
historical buildings from, among other centuries, the 13th.  Now, a bit of a
sprawl, and industrial. The city center sits at the bottom of the slope of a
huge mountain (its ragged, snowcapped peak breaking out of the clouds
periodically), and thus there are fine views in both directions.

More later,

Love,

Mark

cycling club at $35 each, and then we will pay for their registrations.  Jeff 
Skilling's has already been paid for even though he hasn't paid his dues for 
2001.  Effectively,  the bike club pays the registrations through the 
membership fees, and his daughter would be eligible to join with him, so if 
you could forward me a check for $70, and get his/her membership and her 
MS150 form back to me, I'll take care of everything.  (We already have Jeff's 
MS150 registration done, as I said.)

On the fundraising:  Please mention to Jeff that BP, who is the main sponsor 
of this year's tour, has issued a challenge to Enron.  They are seriously out 
to beat us out of first place and they claim that they already have 400 
riders.  We, of course, don't want that to happen, although we are pleased 
with the jump-start we have given to the Houston corporate world in relation 
to this ride.  I'm encouraging our current team members to raise their 
fundraising as much as possible, and especially our top people.  Do you think 
we could get Jeff to $100,000 this year?  Last year he came in at $65,000.  
Wendy Gramm is not riding this year because Phil Gramm has a high school 
reunion the same night, so could Jeff ask Wendy to raise money anyway and 
throw it our way, or she could just raise the money and give herself the 
credit even though she's not riding?  Do you have any ideas on that?  Do you 
want me to contact her to discuss or would it be better for you or Rebecca to 
do that?

didn't get a chance to talk.  Paul and I would appreciate the opportunity
to
set up a meeting before the holidays.  I know it's going to be tough given

Subject:  Genesis Park


Jeff, I've been meaning to corner you at one of the YPO functions to spend
a
minute discussing a couple of topics.  First and foremost, I wanted to
introduce Genesis Park which is a ""new economy"" investment company that's
been recently founded here in Houston by Paul Hobby, Fred Lummis, Steve
Gibson, Peter Shaper, Bruce Herzog and myself.  Paul and I were hoping to
have an opportunity to spend 30 minutes with you in the next few weeks to
describe in person what we're all about.  And to be clear, we're not
looking
for Enron money, we are raising money from private individuals.  We've
already met with Jay Fitzgerald and Steve Horn to establish the
Enron/Genesis business relationship.

I also wanted to get your views on Enron's approach to oil trading and
whether the Vitol Group presented an opportunity.  Frankly, I think Vitol
is
an excellent acquisition target although the success they've enjoyed in the
last year or two will make it a bit more difficult.  They have an
unbelievable franchise, but they also have some fundamental weaknesses
which
could be exploited to Enron's benefit.  I'm shooting in the dark here but
hopefully it's worth some discussion.

If you can free some time during this busy holiday period to meet, it would
be greatly appreciated.  Paul and I could come to your office, or possibly
you could come to our ""offices"" over on Hermann Park.  We're buying 17
acres
on Hermann Park adjacent to the Park Lane Towers which we plan to develop
into a technology park.  For the time being, we are officing in a high tech
shed on the property!

Please let me know.  Thanks/Neil.

""Ajunto is the Enron of IT Sourcing..."" ---  Mike Carter, CEO & Founder,
Ajunto, December 12,  2000

""Skilling notes that  skeptics thought Enron was crazy when it dared to
make  electronic
?markets in energy. His confidence comes  down to his belief in Enron's
market-making model.
?""We have a better business model.  It's a fundamentally better business
model,"" he repeats.
?Some $200 billion in trading  activity on an E-commerce site that's less
than a year old speaks
?volumes about Enron's  ability to mobilize and execute on whatever it puts
its mind  to-however
?the company decides to describe  itself.""
InformationWeek,  11/6/00

""As head of two Enron  pipeline subsidiaries, Mike McConnell knew a lot
more about gas flows
?than he did about data flows last year  when he got a surprise call from
Enron President and
?Chief Operating Officer Jeff  Skilling. Recalls McConnell, ""Jeff went into
this whole  thought
?process about how the Internet is changing  everything. He said, 'We need
to make Enron
?an e-business, and I need a guy that can  run this as a business. We need
to change the way
?we view technology.'?? ""I thought he was a little crazy and I  said,
'Jeff, I'm not a technology person
?at all,? ?'He  said, 'No, seriously -- this is going to be big.' So I took
over as CEO of  Enron Global
?Technology,"" and thus became the company's  de facto CIO, McConnell
explains.

The Paradox of our time
  By George Carlin

  The paradox of our time in history is that we have taller buildings
but shorter tempers; wider freeways, but narrower viewpoints. We spend
more, but have less; we buy more but enjoy less.

  We have bigger houses and smaller families, more conveniences, but
less time; we have more degrees, but less sense; more knowledge, but
less judgment; more experts, yet more problems, more medicine, but less
wellness.

  We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh too
little, drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too late, get up too
tired, read too little, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom.

  We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values. We talk
too much, love too seldom, and hate too often. We've learned how to make
a living, but not a life, we've added years to life, not life to years.

  We've been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing
the street to meet a new neighbor. We conquered outer space but not
inner space.   We've done larger things, but not better things.

  We've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul. We've conquered the
atom, but not our prejudice. We write more, but learn less. We plan
more, but accomplish less. We've learned to rush, but not to wait.

  We build more computers to hold more information to produce more
copies than ever, but we communicate less and less.

  These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion; big men and
small character; steep profits and shallow relationships.

  These are the days of two incomes, but more divorce, fancier houses,
but broken homes.

  These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway morality,
one-night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do everything from
cheer, to quiet, to kill.

  It is a time when there is much in the show window and nothing in the
stockroom. A time when technology can bring this letter to you, and a
time when you can choose either to share this insight, or to just hit
delete.

  Remember; spend some time with your loved ones, because they are not
going to be around forever.

  Remember, say a kind word to someone who looks up to you in awe,
because that little person soon will grow up and leave your side.

  Remember, to give a warm hug to the one next to you, because that is
the only treasure you  can give with your heart and it doesn't cost a
cent.

  Remember, to say ""I Love You"" to your partner and your loved ones, but
most of all, mean it.
  A kiss and an embrace will mend hurt when it comes from deep inside of
you.

Remember to hold hands and cherish the moment for someday that person
will not be there again. Give time to love, give time to speak, give
time to share the precious thoughts in your mind.

  To my family, and all my friends in my life, thanks for being there!

You and I met last April when you spoke at a Rice Alliance event, and you
were quite kind to follow-up my request for a meeting with some Enron
contacts.  I'd appreciate your assistance again.

This week I had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Lay  at the GasTech conference
at the George R. Brown while I was the guest of the Deputy Assistant
Secretary of Energy. During the meeting and subsequent luncheon address, I
was amazed to hear some of the facts about how Enron has 're-invented'
itself  through the power of eBusiness, coupled with a culture anxious to
embrace change.  As I recall, statistics like 70% of today's revenues from
businesses started in the last 10 years.

The  Offshore Technology Conference (OTC) is the industry's largest event
and recently has drawn close to 50,000 participates. The General Session is
the biggest draw at the conference, and for 2001 the topic will be how
eBusiness is transforming the industry. Each of our panel members will have
5 - 7 minutes to share their own company's story then we will move into a
panel discussion mode where we will discuss the future of eBiz in the
industry, barriers to adoption and potential benefits. The following leaders
have accepted our invitation;

1) Theirry Pilenko Schlumberger-GeoQuest, President

2) Bob Peebler  Halliburton, VP of e-Business Strategy and Ventures

3) Steve Peacock  BP, VP of Digital Business


4) Linda Sarandrea PetroCosm, VP of Global Hub Operations

5) Michael LaMotte Bank of America, Managing Director

I WOULD BE DELIGHTED IF YOU WOULD JOIN OUR PANEL. Enron has obviously moved
well beyond petroleum into a number of exciting areas. As I gather, much of
your company's success can be traced to it's leadership, it's culture and
eBusiness tools. Your insights and comments would be very helpful for our
audience, as well as perhaps our other panel members. The event should be
well covered by local and national press.

Shortly we will begin our promotional campaign and would like to include you
as a distinguished member of the panel. Please advise of your interest and
availability.

you so I waited before replying so as not to react in haste. Previously I 
stuck to facts and did not bring things of a personal nature into the 
equation. I feel, however, that there are a few things you should know about 
me and how I have exemplified the ENRON VISION so you can realize why I took 
this so seriously and why am, to be blunt, ticked off at the resolution.
In the 4 years that I worked on the scheduling desk for Clinton I never 
missed a day of work.........not one.
I never took vacation during bid week or during tie out time.
Between 96 - 00 I took all but 3 days vacation between the months of May - 
October so as not to interfere with winter gas operations.
I have had nothing but above average reviews in the past 5 years,  been 
promoted twice, and received special recognition for working shorthanded 
through the winter of 99-00.
As you can see I have consistently put ENRON ahead of personal conveniences 
and strived to do the right thing for the company. I am distressed that the 
very values Enron holds me to ring hollow with regards to how I have been 
treated.
Changing vacation rules, be it legally legitimate, does not exemplify 
INTEGRITYin my eyes!
Not stating a policy change (THERE HAS STILL NEVER BEEN A FORMAL STATEMENT OF 
THIS CHANGE) does not illustrate COMMUNICATION!
Stating that I will be paid for vacation less any I take between now and the 
severance date is deceptive at the least and would not constitute RESPECT, 
EXCELLENCE nor INTEGRITY!
FACT - items 1 - 6 in the original email are 100% true. #2 is of the most 
significance as the words came from the lips of our HR representative that I 
would be paid the vacation amount we discussed UNLESS I TOOK ANY VACATION 
BETWEEN NOW AND JUNE 1st.
FACT - At least 2 people were allowed vacation time off during this 
transition (Susan Weison, Sheri Wallace)
FACT - If you check my vacation records you will find that I have taken a 
vacation EVERY YEAR IN MAY. My request was made, like in all previous years, 
a few weeks before I wanted to take it. HAD I KNOWN THAT THE RULES OF THE 
GAME WERE GOING TO BE CHANGED I WOULD HAVE MADE MY INTENTIONS KNOWN EARLIER.

In conclusion I do not expect, or even wish for a response. I have enjoyed my 
time with Clinton Energy and Enron. I have learned much and forwarded my 
career greatly and for that I am thankful. I just wanted you to know where I 
am coming from and how an unfortunate situation of severance was turned into 
one in which I leave being taught a lesson by Enron that does not make me a 
better person, just a smarter one. This lesson; a spotless record & loyalty 
to a company means very little. It is better to look out for #1. In the end 
the company you work for is going to protect their best interests regardless 
of the rhetoric in their Vision Statement. Thank you for your time.

Respectfully,

Sean Zurbrick

Sean;

Thank you for bringing your concerns to us.  We value the input of our 
employees, and constantly seek ways to improve the quality of our employee 
benefits.  After talking to some of the parties involved in this matter and 
reviewing our vacation policy, we find that your management acted within the 
scope of its responsibility and within the bounds of our vacation policy.  In 
addition, we find no evidence of inconsistencies and believe that you and 
your co-workers at Clinton have been treated equitably and fairly regarding 
the denial of vacation during this transition period. 

In closing, we support the decision to deny vacation requests to the Clinton 
employees affected by this transition.  Should you have any other questions, 
please do not hesitate to direct them to your management

Subject: Clinton Energy Vacation Policy & Request

I have held discussions with Tim Weithman, Ashley Kerr & Ken Brooks 
(immediate supervisor) regarding a request for vacation for the 3rd or 4th 
week in May. I have been told recently by both Ms. Kerr as well as Mr. 
Weithman that those of us being severed from the company are not permitted to 
take any vacation time between now and June 1st. It would seem that there are 
several inconsistencies regarding Enron policy as well as how the subject was 
presented both to the group as well as individually. Below are the 
inconsistencies I speak of.

During the group meeting in the beginning of April there was no mention of 
""vacation freezes"". The only reference to time that was mentioned was that 
you must be employed by Enron as of June 1, 2001 to receive the severance 
package.
During my private discussion, in which both Ms. Kerr and Ms. Gray were 
present, I was presented with the specifics of the severance package. I 
specifically remember being asked for my current unused vacation amount. I 
gave them the amount of 152 hours and was told that I would be reimbursed for 
that total unless, of course, I took any additional vacation. This implied 
that regular Enron vacation policies would be in effect. Again, at no time 
was it presented to me that I was ineligible to take ANY of my earned 
vacation or that there would be any deviations from normal Enron policy 
regarding vacation.
At no time has Mr. Weithman, Ms. Gray, Ms. Kerr or any other Enron agent made 
public a policy of vacation freezes.
At no time were there ever any public or private requests that the plans for 
those with previously scheduled vacations to be made available to any Enron 
agent.
I can find nothing in my severance package that states any deviation from the 
standard Enron vacation policy.
I realize that Enron policy requires vacation approval from the supervising 
employee. It states in that policy the following:
""An employee's preference for scheduling vacation should be adopted when 
possible.""
""The supervisor must verify that unit staffing needs are met before approving 
an employee's vacation request.""
I am currently still an Enron employee.  I have also verified that staffing 
needs are met. 

In summary, as you can see there are several inconsistencies with regards to 
the vacation policy for those being severed at Clinton Energy. It more than 
offends me that I am being prohibited from taken ANY part of the 152 hours of 
accrued vacation that is, by all accounts, mine to take. This being said, I 
am formally requesting one last time that I be granted my vacation request 
during the month of May. Furthermore I would like this approval as soon as 
possible so that I may make necessary arrangements. As you review this I am 
consulting an attorney so that I may be advised of my rights regarding this 
matter.

Thank you,

Sean Zurbrick

Subject: UK CEOs

Jeff,

As you may recall from our discussion on your visit to London last summer, 
one of the challenges we have in Europe is raising the external profile of 
Enron.  To help address this, I recently replaced Ralph in a group of UK CEOs 
which meet monthly, so I can continue to raise awareness of Enron's 
businesses and generally network.   At each lunch meeting which lasts around 
two hours, one of the CEOs makes an informal 20 minute speech on a current 
business subject of their choice and then a discussion follows.

The group has asked if you would like to chair the meeting in September 2001 
on a date of your choice.  At the end of this note there is a list of the 
current membership.  I have been to one meeting and only around a third 
attended.

Please let me know if you are able to commit time to this.  There is no 
problem if you decline.

As you know, the ENA gas floor came in with a $30 million VAR position 
today.  Even though this left us with another $10 million of unused VAR, I 
want to make you aware that we may exceed our VAR limit today. This move up 
was much bigger than the market anticipated, and natural gas volatility was 
up quite a bit. The VAR calculation is now kicked off at 2:00am and we will 
know our VAR position by 6:00am.  If we are over, I will need to ask for a 
one day increase.  I have already told the desk heads that we will most 
likely need to sell some contracts tonight and tomorrow.

Subject: Re: earthquake---are you all right?



Just got on line.  Surprised it was possible.  Electricity out, so probably
only us with battery powered lap tops clogging things up.

Everything ok here, so far.  Got a pretty good shake.  Was out in the
streets for a couple of hours, with everyone else.  My neighborhood up on
solid rock, so things looked mostly ok.  Lots of old and bad construction
here; stones in the street.  One upper floor (abandoned) apartment half a
block from here collapsed and much debris in the stereets.  No apparent
injuries, however, in my neighborhood.  Unfortunately, other areas not so
lucky.  Saw 6.7 estimate for Izmit, the center, here (one place I passed had
a genertor and had a tv out for everyone to see).  Passed women praying, men
reading Koran, most just huddled in groups talking. Strange being in the
middle of it all with limited ability to communicate.  Know a few folks in
neighborhood and we had a few basic chats, though its amazing how much I
learned even from them.  Already knew the Turkish word for earthquake, which
is depram (revolution is devrim) and came in handy.

A few seagulls just went by and I think a neighbor down stairs up and about;
mistook that comotion for an aftershock.  A little rattled myself; much like
after SF quake.  I think memory of that still deep seeded in my
subconscious.

Again, this new technology amazes.  Better get off and save my battery.  May
need it.

Thanks for the note.  It was good to see your messages there.  I'll send
this to the rest of the family, but if they call tell them I'm ok and
worried about them worrying about me.

Love,

Mark

Subject: Enron Candidate


Jeff,

Judy Lay Allen, an associate of yours on the Federal Reserve board, spoke 
with Joannie Williamson today regarding my desire to interview at Enron.

I am a graduate of Princeton University with two years experience in 
financial modeling and communications.   Towards assessing my skill set 
relative to peers, I took and received a 740 on my GMAT.  I have also 
interned in a gas exploration company and am familiar with the industry; 
likewise, I have worked with clients in telecommunications and am aware of 
the work Enron is doing in the bandwidth trading/pooling field.

I am aware of Enron's executive training/business analyst programs and am 
highly interested in exploring opportunities therein.  I am in Houston 
through Friday evening and, given the short notice, would be grateful for any 
opportunity to meet with the appropriate person any time Thursday or Friday.

I look forward to interviewing and applying my experience at Enron.

Best regards,
Michael Kuntz

One of my fellow Turkish students had a fancy camera, and took a picture

too me via e-mail, and now I'm trying to send it to you.  The version I
have isn't very clear, but what the heck.  The water you see behind me
is the Bosphorus, which is a 19 or so mile finger of water that connects
the Black Sea with the Sea of Marmara, in the process splitting Istanbul
in two.  The bridge you see is (cleverly) called the Bosphorus Bridge,
and looks a bit like a silver version of the Golden Gate, and the
portion of Istanbul beyond is European Istanbul.

More later.

Gil,

Jeff asked me to let you know that he really appreciates this opportunity,
but his time in the office is at such a premium right now due to his heavy
travel schedule, it would be difficult at best to work them in.  He has
turned down several invitations to join boards because he just can't commit
the time.  So, while he is flattered by their interest, if and when Mr.
Quackenbush calls we will decline.

It was nice talking to you.  Glad to hear all is well.

Jeff,

Great to see Enron and you doing so well.  Congratulations on the -belated-
CEO ship, the blowout first quarter,
and the recent piece in Bloomberg.

Since we last met Luminant has done a important and impactful work for
Enron
(EES, Enron Networks, Global
Sourcing, Broadband among others).  The Oasis and the Websource Intranet
sites are examples of the results of
this work.  Phillippe recently selected Luminant as one five integrators
that Enron will use going forward.

David Quackenbush, Luminants COO, has been personally involved in leading
the work at Enron.  He and
Jim Corey Luminant's CEO would like to have the opportunity of meeting with
you, bringing you up to date
on the work, and inviting you to consider joining the Luminant board.

I am no longer affiliated with Luminant but David asked me to let you know

following up and seeing if there will be an opportunity for you to meet
with
them.

I will be heading out to Macerich's offices to meet Macerich's management 
team. At that meeting, we will be discussing the outsource and the future 
relationship between the companies.  He would also like me to speak to his 
direct reports about change management and other cultural characteristics of 
Enron.  However, he would really like you to provide a presentation on the 
same general topics to the Macerich Company Conference in June.  He has heard 
you speak and believes your approach and perspective can benefit the

Obviously, these guys are an important relationship and reference for our

Let me know your interest.

Subject: Macerich Conferences


Angela - thanks for making time to have dinner with us on Wednesday:  it
was great to see you.

As Art mentioned, since the time we have started working with you, we have
made frequent references to our operating teams about Enron's
accomplishments in the areas of customer excellence and employee
satisfaction.  More generally, we've held Enron out as an example of a
highly accomplished company in all the areas Macerich is currently focusing
on as an organization (operational integration, customer orientation,
scalability, change leadership, and strategic focus).

All of that being said, we would be extremely appreciative of an
opportunity to have either Jeff Skilling or Dave Delainey speak at either
of these conferences.  In any event, we're delighted that you would make an
effort to see if this can be put together.

Relative to upcoming Macerich events, there are two scheduled:

(1) University of Notre Dame Executive Education Program, May 7 - 9 in
South Bend.  The curriculum is centered on change leadership and strategic
thinking (officially ""Enhanced Leadership and Strategy in the New
Economy"").  Attendees include our Executive Team (Art, David, Rick,Tom, Ed,
and Larry Sidwell) and our Operating Team (17 SVPs).  There is also a
round-table discussion scheduled with our Board on May 9.

(2) Macerich's Company Conference, June 4 - 7 in Park Cities, Utah.  The
emphasis of the conference will be on our ""e-Business Transformation"" (more
specifically on becoming wholly integrated across functional roles,
customer facing, and highly scalable) and capturing value in our ""Value
Network"" (relationships we have with retailers, partners, vendors,
shoppers, etc.)  The attendees for this event include the same people at
UND as well as our managerial professionals from the malls and our
corporate offices (about 250 people, total).

Let me know if you need any additional background or information.

Eric

 Accompanied by the pleasing rat-a-tat-rat of the train wheels slapping the
joints between the rails, we are pulled slowly towards Istanbul.  Adana's (a
city of 1.6 million some 560 miles southeast of Istanbul) cement clutter and
jumbled sprawl are behind us.  It is night now and I imagine this exhausted
land moaning with relief as it is allowed a brief respite until dawn.  Fires
spot the darkened fields -- fields that have been fields longer than any on
this earth.  The silhouettes of men, going about some mysterious chores,
blink out the orange flames from time to time.  I can make out a ragged
black skyline of mountains to the north, scattered before them clumps of
lights marking towns.

Poised above it all, as if balanced by its handle on the palm of some
invisible giant, is the Big Dipper.  The handle points, roughly, in the
direction of Istanbul.  And from the dipper, onto that monstrous city, some
heavenly pap must certainly pour.  Having these last few days traveled
through a tired land full of people beleaguered by poverty, I have new
respect for that ancient town.  Thinking of it now, Istanbul seems imbued
with an almost childlike spunk, and an impressive set of toys with which to
amuse.

 Earlier in the day in Antakya (ancient Antioch, another 120 miles further
southeast of Istanbul), I had just boarded the bus for Adana when a little
girl started saying out loud, to her mother, the names of cities and towns,
some of which she must have seen on road signs.  ""Iskenderun"", ""Adana"", she
pronounced slowly and carefully.  ""Kirikhan"", ""Dortyol,"" she continued.
Then she said ""Istanbul"", with the same care. But it had obviously pleased
her more than the rest, because she repeated it many times, each time with a
bit more zeal, until it finally sounded like a marvelous one-word song.
""Is-stawn-bul, Is-stawn-bul"", she sang out sweetly, her lyric sometimes
punctuated with a short burst of the giggles.  ""Is-stawn-bul!"",
""Is-stawn-bul!""   I doubt I will ever hear or read or say the name again
without hearing her little song.  Even now, I am humming its happy tune.

And you may ask, ""Where was the mother?""  Smiling, I suppose.  And dreaming
of Istanbul.

Thanks for spending some time with us at our office.

On the high yield side, I have never seen my boss so quiet and uncomfortable
at a company meeting.
Rumor is he left early to sell the telecom stocks he held in his own
account.

On the equity side, our utility fund manager is still getting up to speed.
Enron was the last stock I recommended at Loomis Sayles in 1998, and I have
consistantly advocated a
major overweight here at Eaton, but she has been slow to buy and quick to
sell.  I understand she is buying again.

In any event, there is no doubt you made a deep impression on all of the
Eaton participants.

The items Mr. Skilling purchased have arrived in Houston and I'm working with 
a customs broker to get them out of KLM Cargo.  The broker has indicated that 
the packing list and tax invoice are not descriptive enough to get the items 
out of customs, so I need to provide them with a detailed list of items, what 
they are made of and what he paid for them.  Unfortunately, Mr. Skilling is 
out of the country until January 2, 2001, and KLM will only hold these items 
until December 23 when they send them to some government warehouse.  If you 
could e-mail or fax me this information asap it is greatly appreciated.

to

Subject:  Genesis Park


Jeff, I've been meaning to corner you at one of the YPO functions to spend
a
minute discussing a couple of topics.  First and foremost, I wanted to
introduce Genesis Park which is a ""new economy"" investment company that's
been recently founded here in Houston by Paul Hobby, Fred Lummis, Steve
Gibson, Peter Shaper, Bruce Herzog and myself.  Paul and I were hoping to
have an opportunity to spend 30 minutes with you in the next few weeks to
describe in person what we're all about.  And to be clear, we're not
looking
for Enron money, we are raising money from private individuals.  We've
already met with Jay Fitzgerald and Steve Horn to establish the
Enron/Genesis business relationship.

I also wanted to get your views on Enron's approach to oil trading and
whether the Vitol Group presented an opportunity.  Frankly, I think Vitol
is
an excellent acquisition target although the success they've enjoyed in the
last year or two will make it a bit more difficult.  They have an
unbelievable franchise, but they also have some fundamental weaknesses
which
could be exploited to Enron's benefit.  I'm shooting in the dark here but
hopefully it's worth some discussion.

If you can free some time during this busy holiday period to meet, it would
be greatly appreciated.  Paul and I could come to your office, or possibly
you could come to our ""offices"" over on Hermann Park.  We're buying 17
acres
on Hermann Park adjacent to the Park Lane Towers which we plan to develop
into a technology park.  For the time being, we are officing in a high tech
shed on the property!

Please let me know.  Thanks/Neil.

 The European IT Forum 2001 - 11th Edition
 Grimaldi Forum, Monaco, 17 and 18 September
 ""Old and New Worlds Collide in Europe: Will Business Take the Leap?


 Dear Mr. Skilling,

 Business  leaders,  market  players  and media representatives who attend 
IDC's
 European  IT  Forum  each  year  rate it the most prestigious and 
authoritative
 eBusiness conference in Europe.

 Past  speakers  at our Forum have included global business leaders such as 
Bill
 Gates,  Larry  Ellison,  Scott McNealy, Tim Koogle, Michael Capellas, Sir 
Peter
 Bonfield;  Economists  and  Technology  Gurus  Nicholas Negroponte, Gary 
Hamel,
 Jeremy  Rifkin,  George  Gilder,  Geoffrey Moore; Venture Capitalists, 
Bankers,
 eBusiness Stars and the most senior IDC analysts.

 Although  we  are  still  several  months  away  from this year's event, we 
are
 pleased  to  confirm the participation of the following industry leaders: 
Carly
 Fiorina  (CEO  of  HP),  Michael  Capellas  (CEO of Compaq), Jeff Bezos (CEO 
of
 Amazon.com),  Joe  Tucci (CEO of EMC) and the ""gurus"" Gary Hamel, Lester 
Thurow
 and Michael Porter.

 The key themes this year will be:

 -   the Internet stock crash and current economic slowdown
 -   how Internet technologies can help overcome the present financial 
downturn
 -   how the economy of established companies and the new order of dot-coms 
are
 merging
 -   how companies can formulate winning strategies by combining the Internet
 with traditional competitive advantages
 -   how Europe can take advantage of current favorable market conditions to
 catch-up with the US
 -   how investments in Internet infrastructures and eCommerce will drive a
 major economic development worldwide over the next decade

 We  would  be  honoured  if  you  would  accept our invitation to speak at 
this
 important event during the breakout session entitled: ""eBusiness Strategies 
for
 Brick & Mortars""that will take place on Monday 17 September at 16.00-17.30.

 We  anticipate  a  select audience of CEOs and board-level delegates as well 
as
 columnists  from  key  European publications, as well as TV and other 
broadcast
 media.

 We hope that you can accept our invitation to present your vision of the 
future
 of the internet economy at IDC's European IT Forum.

 I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Jeff,

Happy Easter!

A few years ago at the YPO Harvard University, I met a guy from Venezuela.
He and I have kept in contact through the years and we get together from
time to time.  We had dinner a few days ago and he asked me if I thought
you might be interested in meeting with Ali Rodgrigues.  Ali will be in the
US sometimes in May and may be available to meet.  He and my buddy have
been friends for years and I thought I'd extend the offer.  I don't know if
there is an agenda or not.  Those guys are hard to read.  Just let me know
if it's something you want to do.  Otherwise I'll just forget about it.

Keep that stock going up!

Thanks for the details.  Do they get letters about articles and, if so, do
you think I will get to see them (not just the ones they publish, assuming
they publish any)?  Can't wait to see what mom sends.  Tell her thanks ahead
of time.  I was able to pull a copy off the Internet, and it was enjoyable
to see my name in print, esepcially in such an important newspaper.  Thanks
again.

Interesting that in same section another article about Itstanbul was run,
and that in my article I mentioned the Hagia Sophia, the subject of that
other article.

Have felt an aftershock or two in the last week, but not the relatively big
one that killed a man.  And what I've felt nothing more than a little wiggle
of the earth.  (If you recall, on the morning of the big one I went back to
sleep, during which I felt lots of them (though again all not much more than
as if a truck went by the building).

Hope all goes well and you are not working too too hard (I know you're
workng too hard).  Hope we get a good bit of time together when I'm in
Chicago.  Maybe we can at least meet for grub on Sunday somewhere in near
your place.

purposes that particular day and would be subject to company policy on all 
charges.

No problem if this doesn't work!

I wanted to take quick moment to report to you on the great
progress we have made over the past few months in our effort
to elect a pro-business Congress.

The U.S. Chamber PAC has been actively involved in dozens of
important races across the country. We believe these races will
make the difference on November 7th in electing a Congress that
will work with us to find solutions, rather than more
regulations, to challenges when they arise.

Now, we need your help to continue this important work. During
the next 5 weeks, the U.S. Chamber PAC will continue to support
these candidates through direct contributions, endorsements,
newspaper ads, direct mail, and even radio and television
campaigns when appropriate.

You can help today by making a personal contribution to the
U.S. Chamber PAC. To make this contribution now, please:

1. Complete the U.S. Chamber PAC solicitation form that
allows us to solicit contributions from you and your
organization's executive and administrative employees.
Simply click here
- http://www.uschamber.com/Elections/_pacform.htm,
print the form, sign it and fax it back to the Chamber.

2. After completing the PAC solicitation form, Click on
the following for our secure contribution page to make your
contribution.
https://www.econtributor.net/Contribution/Login.cfm?AID=GGOHCEJNZCHG.

Also, during the next 5 weeks, Tom Donohue will be traveling
across the country to attend campaign events on behalf of the
candidates we support. We will continue to keep you updated
on these events and hope you will come out to show your support
for these pro-business candidates when he is in your area.

However, we need to make sure the U.S. Chamber PAC is able to
completely fund our Elections 2000 Program. To help us today,
please complete the solicitation form and then visit our secure
contribution page at
https://www.econtributor.net/Contribution/Login.cfm?AID=GGOHCEJNZCHG.

Your contribution of $150, $100, $75, or $50 will make the
difference this November 7th and help us continue to campaign
for pro-business candidates who have been there for us when it
has counted most and who will be there for us in the future.
The guidelines above are merely suggestions and you may give
more or less, or not at all without concern of favor,
disadvantage, or reprisal.

Thank you and I hope the U.S. Chamber PAC can count on your
support today!

Sincerely,

Bill Miller
Political Director


P.S. Contributing to the U.S. Chamber PAC online if quick
and easy! However, if you have not yet done so, please remember
to complete our solicitation form by clicking here

my current incarnation, though, as Editorial Director for the Harvard
Business School Publishing Co. and head of its publishing division--we
publish the Harvard Business Review, HBS Press books (including Leading the
Revolution from your friend and skiing companion Gary Hamel), and the best
selling management newsletter in the country, among other things--that I
wanted to put a proposition before you to see if we might interest you in
what I think may be an important idea-development and publishing
opportunity.
HBSPC has become quite interested in the subject of corporate venturing, of
how companies can invest in innovation and new organizational forms (but you
know all about that) in a transformative way, so much so that we're planning
to put on a couple of conferences on the subject next year. (The purpose of
our conferences, in general, is to push ideas ahead and advance the thinking
on a particular topic.) They will be smallish, half-day affairs--we're
looking at an audience of perhaps 75 senior executives at each--one in New
York in January, the second in San Francisco, probably the first week in
February. As with the authors of the books and HBR articles that we publish,
we're committed to having only top-flight experts on the program, mostly on
panels. (For instance, we're talking with the Harvard Business School
professors who teach the executive education course on corporate venturing
about their serving on and putting together one of the panels.) And we, of
course, thought of you and Enron--who knows more about the subject? As we've
designed the conferences, we've concluded that a great way to begin the
program would be to have a sort of a keynote from a CEO grounded in the
real-world experience of making this happen. But we don't want to impose on
your time, or that of your staff, to put together a speech. Our thought was
to have the session be more like ""A conversation with..."", wherein an
interlocutor (probably me, but maybe assisted by a couple of others) would
put questions to you, and draw you out on the points you thought important.
We could confer on the questions beforehand as much or little as you'd like.
Ken Chenault of American Express has agreed to play this role at the New
York conference. We'd wondered if there were any possibility of interesting
you in it for the San Francisco conference? Enron has the best record of any
company on this front, and my secret hope is that the conversation might
serve as the basis of an article (or even the first step toward a book?)
that HBSP might eventually publish. We know, too, that you have endless
demands on your time, and if it would help you to think more favorably of
using it in this way, we'd be happy to provide an honararium for the charity
or charities of your choice.
I'm sure you're besieged with emails on your return from vacation,  but if
you have a moment to marinate on this, we'd welcome the chance to answer any
questions you might have about the event. I have two offices and two phone
numbers (New York, Monday, Tuesday, and most Fridays, at 212-872-9281,
Boston the rest of the week at 617-783-7535) but the most efficient way for
your office to schedule a conversation might be to have them be in touch
with Maria Carnevale here in New York at 212-872-9285) or just shoot me back
an email.
Thanks for taking the time for this overlong email. Our eyes are beginning
to open here to the landscape shaking, transformative possibilities of
corporate venturing, as became clear to you long ago. We'd be grateful for
the opportunity to help you share some of your wisdom with others.
All the best,
Walter Kiechel

Statement Regarding Police Chief Mark Kroeker

""I take my responsibilities as police commissioner very seriously.  I have
reviewed this situation with care.  I want to thank those who provided me
feedback either in person, over the telephone or through e-mail.

""The performance of any individual in my administration ultimately rests
with me.  I want to apologize for the concern, pain and fear caused by the
taped comments made years ago by Chief Kroeker.  His taped comments in no
way reflect my own personal beliefs.

""My community and staff discussions, along with reading all the e-mails and
transcripts of all my telephone messages, helped distill my thinking on this
issue to one key question: Can Chief Kroeker separate his personal religious
views from his professional conduct?

""I have determined that he manages his duties without bias and will continue
to do so. His performance has met my expectations.  He is leading the bureau
in a fair, respectful and inclusive manner.  He is moving our law
enforcement efforts to a higher level of community policing.  Therefore, I
have asked Mark Kroeker to stay on as Chief of Police.  He has my strong
support to continue.

""The law provides that all city employees have a right to their personal
religious views.  I have a responsibility to review their employment status
if their actions, as a result of their personal views, impair their ability
to perform their professional responsibilities.

""Many of the arguments raised asking me to dismiss Mark Kroeker because he
is ""out of step with Portland"" could be used in other Oregon communities to
fire more liberal public officials who are ""out of step"" with their
community's conservative majority.  My 30-year fight for tolerance goes both
ways.

""Chief Kroeker will have to rebuild trust with many of our citizens.   He
assures me he is prepared to do so.  He told me he would rather help undo
the damage, help me promote tolerance and acceptance of all people, than
just walk away.

""He commits to a strong and sustained positive dialogue with Portlanders who
are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered, including those on his staff.
He has already begun outreach efforts and will continue to do so.

""He said he will redouble his efforts to promote respect and acceptance of
all Portlanders and be steadfast and fair in his enforcement of the law.

""He agrees to work with the Cascade Aids Project to serve as a spokesperson
to educate citizens about the fact that AIDS is not a ""gay disease.""

""He will continue to seek advice from the City Council, the Bureau's Sexual
Minority Roundtable and others to guide additional efforts.

""He agrees to take all this on with all his heart.

""In the process I hope he and we all learn from this experience.  I will
work to turn this negative situation into a positive one: to expand our
sense of tolerance; to promote the notion that regardless of a person's
personal or religious beliefs, one can be an effective public servant; and
to deepen the acceptance of all Portlanders.

""As Mayor, I will do my part and more.  I hope you will join me.""

******E-NEWS THIS WEEK*******

SONATRACH ASK FOR PATIENCE OVER OZ2 PIPELINE CONTRACTS
Algiers - Sonatrach has asked bidders to extend until the end of 2000 offers
made for the $1bn OZ2 pipeline system, designed to extend the capacity of
the crude oil corridor from the central el_hamra oil field to the Arzew
terminal west of Algiers. The extension will allow the company more time to
evaluate the bids
About six companies/groups are understood to be bidding for the three
contracts which are estimated to be worth $220-250m each. They include CCC;
a consortium of Bonatti, with Entrepose and Dragados & Construcciones and
Bechtel. The first two contracts involve the construction of the pipelines
with a third contract for six pumping stations. The recent political changes
in Algeria, combined with internal administrative changes in Sonatrach, are
said to have contributed to the delay.


OIL PRICES RISE OVER ISRAELI CONFLICT
London - Oil prices soared on global markets last night following rising
tensions in the Middle East.
London Brent blend futures rose 72 cents to $31.48 but remains short of a
10-year high $34.98 touched last month. US light crude was up 92 cents at
$32.79 helped by speculators returning to buy oil after a two-week sell-off.
Following Saudi Arabia's warning that Riyadh and other Arab states would not
""watch with their hands tied"" if Israel attacked Lebanon or Syria, the cost
of a barrel of crude went up almost a dollar to $32.79 (o22.60) in New York.
Earlier the International Energy Agency set alarm bells ringing when it said
the West was heading into winter with inventories well below the seasonal
norm.
Oil prices have retreated from their 10-year peaks last month after pressure
from the G7 industrial nations on producers to pump more crude and the US
decision to release 30m barrels from its strategic reserve. After briefly
dipping below $30, prices have risen amid concerns that demand will exceed
supply in the coming months, particularly if the violence in Israel leads to
a broader conflict. Oil prices are seen as a threat to the prospects of low
inflation in the West, and yesterday's increases spilled over into bond
markets, where worries about Wall Street and energy shortages had already
driven yields higher.
A wave of violence between Palestinians and Israelis over the past 12 days
has killed at least 90 people, mostly Palestinians.


BUY-BACK TERMS SET TO CHANGE
Tehran - In an interview with Petroleum Argus this month, Mehdi Hosseini,
former Deputy Oil Minister for international Affairs and now Managing
Director at Kala, the procurement arm of NIOC based in London, indicated
that future negotiations with foreign oil companies will take place using
more favourable terms.
NIOC is reportedly close to implementing a more attractive buy-back formula.
Since the Islamic Republic re-opened its doors to foreign oil companies in
1997, executives had quietly bemoaned the buy-back formula as offering small
capital returns on huge investments. Despite this, Iran's energy buy-back
projects have so far attracted close to $10bn capital to the Iranian energy
sector. NIOC argues that it is their duty to negotiate terms favourable to
its population rather than to foreign entities. It now appears that in the
face of increased competition for foreign investment from its Gulf
neighbours, NIOC is prepared to compromise. For further details please visit
http://www.petroleumargus.co.uk


TURKIOG' 2000 UPDATE
London - Please be advised that time is running out to register for TURKIOG'
2000 conference in Istanbul on 16th and 17th of November. The event,
supported and endorsed by the Ministry of Energy & Natural Resources, Botas,
Tupras, TPAO, Directorate of Petroleum Affairs and Petkim, has now attracted
in excess of 600 delegates according to the organisers, ITE Exhibitions. The
supporting exhibition has attracted the participation of over 100 companies,
all of whom want to participate at what will prove to be the country's main
oil and gas event of 2000.
The MENA Petroleum Bulletin is pleased to offer you the chance to join us at

hand writing can be somewhat difficult to read. 

Before you decide the methodology for moving our project beyond the D. Ambani 
phone call, I would like to share a few thoughts that I believe reduces the 
risk of Enron being an E&P buyer.  I know the implications of making a large 
E&P purchase are far greater than just the cash requirement, but I believe 
with the following changes to the plan presented yesterday and a little 3rd 
party information, you may feel more comfortable making this decision.  Under 
the buy/sell arrangement a small risk of buying will always be present, but I 
believe the risk reward ratio in this case has very strong merit.  My goals 
for Enron are three fold; a) sale the assets, b) get cash in the door before 
year-end, and c) get fair value for the assets given the current situation.  
My comments touch upon five topics:

1)  Reverse the buy/sell process giving Enron the control vote
2)  Pay the Penalty
3) Contact someone at the Janus Fund to talk about Reliance's Financial 
condition
4) Thoughts on non-Reliance bidder's
5) Information and the future process

Reverse the Buy/Sell Process:   The plan outlined yesterday using the 
buy/sell scenario is the best scenario for achieving all of our goals.  The 
risk for Enron which is most troubling is the possibility of being a buyer 
versus a desire to be a seller.  I firmly believe if we make one change to 
the plan as described below, we can increase our probability of a successful 
sale to near 100%.  If we don't use a but/sell arrangement I am concerned 
that we will not get fair value or cash in the door this year.   In fact, I 
suspect we will elect not to sell because of contract or valuation problems, 
which in effect leave us with a stranded asset and a lot of employee 
problems.   

When you talk with Dhirubhai we can propose the buy/sell concept  with RIL 
making the first bid to purchase.  Enron then has the right to sell at that 
price or increase the bid by 5% and RiL must sell.  Since we are now in the 
control position the 10% tax logic we talked about yesterday no longer is 
valid, so I would describe the 5% as a control premium.  The only reason we 
want the buy option is in the event they offer a very low number.  I would 
suspect them to bid in the $550 to $650 million range.  They just turned down 
my offer to purchase their assets at $450mm and indicated we were 
substantially below their value when I tried to engage them in a dialogue.  
They know Enron paid $620 million just 12 months ago for the same position.  
We know they internally have reserves booked higher than ours and have a 
strong desire to have a substantial upstream position that they can control.  
It is possible that RIL would bid less than $500 million but I put that 
probability at less than one percent.  This reduces Enron's risk dramatically 
and increases our probability of getting all of our objectives met. We also 
get an added benefit, from pitching the deal with RIL as the first bidder,  
because this will  strengthen the perception that we (Enron) want to be the 
buyer, which is a key perception to have a fair auction with only one 
legitimate buyer, Reliance.  

If we  pitch the deal as suggested above,  we need to recognise going in that 
they probably want the control position as well.  I believe they would pay a 
very large value for these assets due to their tax position and by bidding 
first they take great risk of leaving a lot of money on the table or not 
getting the deal at all.   I would suspect that they will at a minimum 
suggest we flip a coin to see who bids first.  Initially I would just say no, 
but we may need to deal with this issue and probably should decide early on 
if it is a deal killer.  If we did flip a coin, we would wait until the 
documents were final and the escrow agreement was signed so there would be no 
backing out without a penalty.  In this scenario it would actually help get a 
more impartial document done quicker if neither party knew the bidding 
sequence until after the drafting was finalized.

Pay the Penalty: While it is not the way we want to do business, the worst 
case scenario under the proposed escrow agreement is to forfeit  $25 million 
if we elected not to follow through in an Enron  buy scenario.   Considering 
the upside to the buy/sell under either sequence (Enron first or RIL first) 
it may be worth the risk of losing the escrow under a black Friday scenario.  
I want to think about this over the weekend, but while I was thinking this 
afternoon the risk reward seems to be very favorable.  

Contact someone at Janus Fund:  This was suggested yesterday and I would 
strongly urge you to do this if you feel comfortable making the inquiry.  
Janus bought approximately a  5% position in RIL about 1-2 months ago.  I 
think you will get a very positive report on both the cash front and their 
desire to make the upstream a key part of the company.

Thoughts on Non- Reliance Bidders:  I have spent a lot more time thinking 
about this issue.   I can talk you through the reasons, but as long as 
Reliance is involved and a western company can only purchase a 30% 
non-operated working interest, we will have to take a huge discount to fair 
value.  I will be very surprised if we could get $450 million.  Again, going 
to the Shell's, BG's,,,etc  early on in the process,  I believe, is a huge 
mistake, both internally and externally.

Information Flow and Process:  Ken this is a very sensitive area but I feel 
compelled to mention this to you.  I am concerned about too many people 
knowing our plan and strategy and possibly others wanting to branch out with 
the intentions of helping, but actually causing problems.  This needs to be 
managed by one person, not three or four.  To meet all of our objectives this 
has to be an orchestrated deal from a to z.  I think you know more about my 
background then most others in Enron.  I worked the E&P M&A business for 10 
years and did pretty well at it.  I know the oil business and I believe that 
is a key to getting a good deal done.  I know these assets and all of the 
complex issues surrounding the assets, our subsidiaries, tax issues and the 
book considerations.  I'm the best person to get this deal done once you 
decide the risk the company is willing to take.  I know the limits of my 
authority and I will work within those bounds and keep the OOC completely and 
totally informed so proper decisions can be made when necessary. 

Ken, I promise you I will use others in the company where and when 
appropriate.  If I need help in India, I would not hesitate to ask Sanjay for 
such.  However, the last thing we can afford is excess discussion in India on 
this deal.  If Dhirubhai agrees to the deal, we need to get a meeting set in 
Europe at a neutral site to start the process.  My main objective is to  have 
a successful deal.  

I have decided not to go to India so we can concentrate on moving this 
forward.  Also, I will need your guidance on the future of the E&P plans for 
Enron when we decide the direction we plan to take on Panna, Mukta and 
Tapti.  I have looked at the key people necessary to make this happen and can 
talk to you about that as well if you so desire.

They offered Enron an opportunity to invest in a patented method of 
generating electricity by converting methane to hydrogen and burning hydrogen 
in a high efficiency turbine.  This patent represents an idea, without any 
exhaustive quantitative analysis or research and without any prototype 
demonstrated in the field or a lab.

We politely told Mr. Hatchett that we would review his proposal and get back 
to him.

Subsequently, we conveyed to Mr. Hatchett that a) methane consumption rate 
for an integrated facility based on the subject patent is higher than the 
conventional plant efficiency b) the result in fuel cost is higher c) the 
overall Co2 emissions are probably higher d) there is no economical or 
technical justification to support an investment of Enron funds.  

We informed Bob Hatchett that we would recommend to Enron that Enron not 
invest in the development of this effort.  While we invited Mr. Hatchett to 
respond back to us regarding our analysis, I see no further action required 
by us at this time.

Ken: Please note that Mr. Lars Uno Thulin has asked to meet with Bob Fisher 
of Hills and Company and I on Friday, December 1 while we are in Oslo to 
promote our campaign to get energy services support in the WTO. This meeting 
and others in Brussels and Dusseldorf earlier that week had been requested by 
the USTR as part of the grass roots outreach program. Considerable support 
for energy services has been building according to USTR although our own 
people indicated to Bob Fisher and me several days ago that Enron may not 
want to provide funding for the Energy Services Coaltion beyond December. 
Further, with my pending retirement in March, there is a question as to who 
from industry will lead the coaltion. Bob Fisher gave Rick a paper on 
developments and funding for the future although I submitted in my 2001 
budget proposal fully funding the effort.

Do you have any advice regarding a possible meeting with Mr. Thulin?

Dear Joe Hillings,

Please find enclosed a draft programme for your visit to Oslo. It is meant
as a proposal only, and we would like to hear your comments, and how this
might suit your needs and wishes. May I add a few practical and explanatory
points:
* I understand that you will be coming in on Wednesday afternoon. From
the Airport there is an express train that takes you to the down town area
in less than 20 minutes, considerably quicker than by car. I would be happy
to meet you at the Grand Hotel in the evening for an informal talk, unless
you have other plans. I would also be happy to accompany you  throughout the
programme.
* The people that you will meet in the MFA will basically be those
dealing with the WTO-negotiations, and who are all familiar with the
proposals on energy services. So we could talk on how to deal with the issue
in the ongoing and coming negotiations.
* You will meet key personalities in the Ministry for oil and energy
* Director General Arne Walther is host for a luncheon - he is
currently holding the positions as Chairman of the Board of the
International Energy Agency (IEA)
* You are invited as Key Note Speakers at a workshop on energy
services in the house of The Federation of Norwegian Business and Industry,
which will invite a selected group of leading personalities throughout the
energy business sector in Norway.
* I understand that you will host a dinner in the evening; I would be
happy to advise you on participants, as appropriate; I presume that you ,
i.a., will invite representatives from your company and the US Embassy
* I talked to the CEO of STATKRAFT, Mr. Lars Uno Thulin, who is a good
friend of mine, and who also is well acquainted with the President of Enron,
Mr. Ken Lay. He would appreciate an opportunity for a private conversation,
and suggests a breakfast Friday morning as an option. Please let me know if
this is possible.

I wish you and Bob Fisher very welcome to Oslo!

Yours sincerely

Torbj""rn Fr""ysnes

  Dear Ambassador Froysnes:

  I called this morning to introduce myself and to see how we
should proceed
  to extend invitations to attendees at our workshop and lunch
at the Grand
  Hotel in Oslo, Thursday, November 30th. Bob Fisher, trade
counsel to the
  Energy Services Coalition and I will be arriving in Oslo the
evening of
  Wednesday, November 29th and staying until the morning of
Friday, December
  1st. We would be pleased to host you and guests of your
choice for dinner
  either Wednesday or Thursday evening.

  I would be most grateful if you could advise if you have
already begun to
  invite participants for our workshop and lunch on Thursday,
November 30 or
  if I should undertake that task under your direction.

  Regards,

  Joe

Can you go ahead and contact the band, I sent an e-mail to the wedding 
coordinator and she has not responded (she is new to e-mail) and I'm afraid 
we might lose them. Also, she recommended a photographer out of Atlanta, I 
love his work, he does candid more so than the traditional portraits. He also 
did a number of the Kennedy's weddings, etc. I'll try and get a price quote, 
but I might need your help in negotiations. Also, she send some information 
on a decorator/ florist who seems phenomenal, I don't know if Linda might be 
willing to help me out with that as she knows a lot more about both flowers 
and decoration than I do. The Ballroom at the Ritz is pretty basic and he can 
turn it into anything but basic. Also, that we if we find a church that is 
not so amazing, he can decorate that as well. 
The name of the photographer is Dennis Reggie and his number is 404- 
873-8088.  Linda Kessler has all the information on the florist, her number 
is 888 524 1326.
Mom is going to be responsible for the RSVP's for the wedding.  I will get a 
fax machine this weekend. 
Let me know if this is a problem and I will try and arrange some of this from 
down here, it is just difficult for people to call internationally.

I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but this is a hoax:

http://urbanlegends.about.com/culture/urbanlegends/library/blemtax2.htm

Here's an excerpt from the U.S. Postal Service's published response:

A completely false rumor concerning the U.S. Postal Service is being
circulated over the Internet via e-mail.
The e-mail message claims that a ""Congressman Schnell"" has introduced ""Bill
602P"" to allow the federal government to impose a 5-cent surcharge on each
e-mail message delivered over the Internet. The money would be collected by
Internet Service Providers and then turned over to the Postal Service.

No such proposed legislation exists. In fact, no ""Congressman Schnell""
exists.

October 13, 2000

This past Wednesday eveing, the cocktail party in honor of the National
Audubon Society=01,s Living Ocean, held at the home of W. Graham Arader III=
 at
1016 Madison Avenue, was a stellar event, drawing a crowd and raising
awareness.  The focus of the event was the launching of the =01&Just Ask=01=
8
campaign, aimed at protecting the creatures of the sea by expanding consume=
r
awareness about food from the ocean.  Attendees sampled delicious recipes
from some of the top US chefs, all of whom used fish recommended by the
=01&Seafood Lover=01,s Almanac,=018 a beautifully designed, whimsical guide=
 to fish
and shellfish that serves to help consumers become more familiar with the
seafood they eat.
.
Edited by Ms. Mercedes Lee (with Suzanne Iudicello and Dr. Safina
contributing), the Seafood Lover=01,s Almanac provides readers with crucial
information regarding sea life: what is safe to eat, for example, and which
species are endangered.  Many seafoods commonly available today are much
less plentiful than the average consumer might think.  Consumers hold the
greatest influence over the buying decisions of seafood wholesalers and
retailers, and with the efforts of the National Audubon Society this issue
will have a much greater chance of receiving widespread attention.

America=01,s top seafood chefs (and their spectacular creations) were in
attendance, including Rick Moonen, of Oceana, New York; Todd English,
Kingfish Hall, Boston; Jonathan Eismann, Pacific Time, Miami; Robert
Kinkead, Kinkead=01,s, Washington, D.C.; and Terence Feury, Striped Bass,
Philadelphia.  The sampling of food ranged from Margarita Oysters to
Dungeness Crabcakes with Chipotle Vinaigrette, Sesame Seared Tuna with
seaweed salad, pickled ginger, wasabe and fried wontons, all served up in a=
n
irresistible fashion.  Best of all, the chefs generously shared their
recipes to all who whished to recreate these delicious appetizers at home.

Other notable guests included Jennifer Bogo, Associate Editor for The
Environment Magazine; Barbara Fairchild, Editor and Chief of Bon Appetite;
Mindy Fox of the Earth Pledge Foundation; Jennifer Herman of Martha Stewart
Magazine; Ray Isle, Senior Editor of Wine & Spirits; James Rodewald, Senior
Editor of Gourmet; and of course, Graham Arader, a long time supporter of
the Audubon Society, who would not have missed the event for the world.

The evening was permeated by celebration and enthusiasm for the new =01&Jus=
t
Ask=018 campaign: a wonderful sign that support for the Audubon Society and=
 all
of its fundamental projects continues to grow.  Please do not hesitate to
contact us if you would like information on how you can make a contribution
to the invaluable efforts of the National Audubon Society.

Subject: Reforestation projects at Panama - Mr.Kenneth Lay


ENRON
Mr.Kenneth Lay
Chairman & CEO
________________

Dear Mr.Lay:

It's a pleasure to get in contact with you, in order to expose our request.

We are a Reforestation Company from Panama, members of the American Chamber
of Commerce (AMCHAM), the Spanish Chamber of Commerce and the Board of
Director of the Panamanian National Association of Reforestators and we are
constituted for four different groups, with a headquarters in Panama City,
and offices in New York and Miami, in addition to several clothing and shoes
companies in Colon Free Zone, chain of retail stores at Panama City, real
estate, etc.

At present, we have 1200 reforested hectares (1 ha = 2,47 acre) with
teakwood trees. Our program is to extend the plantations, in order to
complete 2000 hectares the next year and 4000/5000 hectares (at least), in
the next 5/8 years with the participation of new investors.

As our strategy, we have in mind to invite new investment groups to
incorporate our projects, through the formation of Joint Ventures for
develope them together, or to start new forestal projects with tropical
species apts for the panamanian type soil. The tropical species have an high
aggregate value in the international market.

Because this, we want to get in contact with your group to invite you to
invest in our forestal projects. We haven't problem with the lands and
dimension of projects.

It's very important to detail, that our project need to be for your group,
part of the environmental corporative strategy in this area (Central
America), due at Panama don't have big extension of lands.

Our company will offer, in this case, the guarantees could be necessary.

Must have in mind, all the advantages existing in Panama, which are:

- Money currency is the U.S.Dollar, which gives stability that few countries
actually have,

- Low internal costs,

- Low annual inflation, which the past 15 years has been 1,3%,

- Strategical geographic position,

- Forestal Law exempts free to tax all profits obtain in Reforestation.

If you have interest in our proposal, we will send you more information
about our company by courrier.

Please, let me know your comments about our request.

Thank you in advance for your attention, we will kindly await for your
response.

Hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,

Alberto Mantel

You will be pleasantly surprised to receive this e-mail from an Enron=20
Employee.

Please note that you are the first and only person in Enron that will know=
=20
about the endeavors that this e-mail discusses.

Background:
In 1986 while I was taking a graduate course in Economics as part of my MBA=
=20
program, I started to think that there exists some similarities between=20
Economics and Thermodynamics. In 1988, I discussed my initial thoughts with=
=20
Dr. Ibrahim Oweiss, professor of Economics at Georgetown University and we=
=20
agreed to investigate this topic. Since that time, I worked with Professor=
=20
Oweiss on and off investigating the subject. In the last couple of years, w=
e=20
started to make good progress, that was culminated recently by submitting=
=20
three papers for publication (see table below). =20

1=09On the Analogies between =01&Economics=018 and =01&Thermodynamics=018=
=09Part I: =01&Basics=018
=09=09This part identifies certain analogies between Economics and Thermody=
namics.=20
The analogies between =01&Abilities=018 and =01&Energy=018, =01&Utility=018=
 and =01&Work=018,=20
=01&Capital=018 and =01&Heat=018, =01&Marginal Utility=018 and =01&Pressure=
=018, =01&Relative Income=018=20
and =01&Temperature=018, as well as =01&LABOR EFFORT=018 and =01&Entropy=01=
8 are discussed.
=09=09This part concludes that the suggested analogies bring about new appr=
oaches=20
that will explain some economic complexities by borrowing or building upon=
=20
some  concepts, theories and experiences in Thermodynamics.
=09=09Part II: =01&Applications=018
=09=09This second Part builds upon the basics introduced in Part I where an=
alogies=20
between Economics and Thermodynamics have been drawn. In this Part, the=20
application of the analogies is utilized to analyze some of the topics=20
economists deal with. This Part presents a fresh approach that holds=20
promising vehicles that can explain some of the paradoxes economists have=
=20
been facing for years. =09Submitted for publications as a working paper at =

e Production Theory.
=09=09Unlike the conventional approach of relating production to Capital an=

along the line suggested by Cobb Douglas, the approach this paper takes is=
=20
relating the production to utility change which in turn is related to chang=
es=20
in capital and labor effort.=20
=09=09This approach affords more generality and helps in the explanation of=
 some=20
paradoxes that the Cobb Douglas theory could not explain. =09Submitted for=

new growth theory.=09Submitted for publications in =01&Economic Theory=018,=
 October 2000)

    =20
A fourth paper entitled ""Innovation: Why"" is under preparation. In this=20
paper, we are able to substantiate  based on the concept of  the Capital=20
Engine that innovation is the most important driver for economic growth. Yo=
u=20
can see why I chose these two words in the title of the paper from my Enron=
=20
world.

I have been collaborating with Professor Oweiss on my own time and I am=20
pleased that we managed to get to this point. Professor Oweiss and I are no=
w=20
convinced that we have reached some breakthroughs that could revolutionize=
=20
the study of Economics. We also feel that we can build further on what we=
=20
reached, and even making more valuable contributions.

I am sure that you will be pleased to learn of the above, of course being a=
n=20
Economist you shall appreciate it even more.

As I reach this critical stage on our path of this research project,  I wou=
ld=20
like to seek Enron support in two areas:

I.   Patent(s) / Copy Righting:
     I feel that the contributions that are covered in the three papers are=
=20
original and may warrant patenting / copy righting.=20
     Since I am the primary author of these papers I wanted to have some=20
credit go to Enron.

II.  Grant / Sponsorship:
     I feel that my endeavors which have been purely on my own personal tim=
e=20
so far, need to be replaced by a more concerted effort now that we have=20
reached a =20
     critical mass. Towards this end, Dr. Oweiss and myself are taking step=
s=20
to get funding from the National Science Foundation for a joint research=20
project that=20
     would be carried out through the Georgetown University.
     I do not know of any particular programs within Enron that would affor=
d=20
me the opportunity to complete a project like the one we are envisaging. =
=20
     I feel that such a research program will be very valuable.  I am furth=
er=20
convinced that such program will not be only of an academic value but it wi=
ll=20
have=20
     significant impact to the business world.

 I trust that the publicity that Enron being the leading company in=20
innovation would get out of the success that I am hoping for  the proposed=
=20
research project will be many folds the amount of money Enron would=20
contribute to the proposed effort.=20

I would be delighted to send you copies of the three papers and / or make a=
=20
brief presentation on the subject.

I wish to thank you for taking the time to read the above e-mail amid your=
=20
busy schedule.=20

Enron Public Affairs has launched a new initiative: ENRON  UNIVERSITY  
AFFAIRS.  The overall mission of Enron University Affairs is to broaden the 
depth and scope of our relationships with targeted universities through 
building Enron brand recognition on campuses, leveraging research exchanges 
of intellectual capital between Enron and the Academic community, and 
enhancing commercial opportunities for Enron.  Additionally, this initiative 
will further Enron's efforts to hire and retain the world's most innovative 
employees.

I am leading this initiative, as Vice President, joined by Mike Rosen as a 
Director. Cindy Derecskey will also work with our team in conjunction with 
her position as public affairs coordinator.

Currently, Harvard Business School is developing a case study ""to capture the 
evolution of Enron's business model and the underlying entrepeneurial 
culture, which made that evolution possible"". A significant part of the 
research centers on how Enron manages its intellectual capital. 
Harvard Professor Christopher Bartlett, Daewoo Professor of Business 
Administration and Chair, Program for Global Leadership, is leading this 
effort, assisted by Meg Wozny, his research associate at Harvard Business 
School.  Professor Bartlett and Ms. Wozny have already co-written case 
studies on General Electric and Microsoft.

Jeff Skilling has already met/interviewed with Professor  Bartlett  and Ms. 
Wozny, along with several other Enron Management members.

Cindy , Tom,  Andy,  Gene,  Mark  and  Rick, we are trying to schedule one 
hour meetings with each of you Wednesday, October 11th,  Thursday October 
12th, or Friday  October 13th.

Please  reply with your preferred 1 hour time slot asap.

Hi Christie:

Prof. Bartlett and I would like to capture the evolution of Enron's
business model and the underlying entrepreneurial culture, which made that
evolution possible.  A big part of our research is Enron's management of
intellectual capital as a critical strategic resource.  We'd like to
understand how Enron attracts, recruits, motivates and develops top talent
and how it creates the behavioral context that ensures that individual
entrepreneurial initiative is incorporated into organizational bloodstream.

Prof. Bartlett has already met with Jeff Skilling and Greg Whalley.  Jeff
suggested Prof. Bartlett meet Ken Lay, Gene Humphrey, Mark Frevert, Andrew
Fastow and Cindy Olsen.

I've met Mark Palmer and Steve Kean as well as Louise Kitchen
(EnronOnline), Ken Rice, David Cox, Kevin Hannon, and Richard diMichele
(Broadband Business).  We are planning to take Enron's culture for a test
drive in a separate case study on Louise Kitchen and EnronOnline launch.

Here are the dates that will work for us:
October 10  13
October 18  20
October 26-27
November 20-21

Thank you for your help, and please let me know if you need any additional
information.

Best regards,
Meg

PS Attached is Prof. Bartlett's bio.  I'm his research associate, and we've 
co-written case studies on General Electric, Microsoft and ResMed.

Dear Family,
Heather and I were talking about NYC and thought we
should make some reservations for dinner for the
entire family on Friday and Saturday night. I am
trying to get reservations for the entire family at Le
Cirque 2000 for Friday night at 7:30 but we will be
very lucky to get in. Does anyone have other
suggestions or an objection to Le Cirque? I am
attaching a review of the restaurant. It is definitely
a little ""Haute"" but I've heard it is also a lot of
fun. Heather is looking into Italian restaurants for
Saturday night, as well.

This is just a suggestion but we were worried that we
may have difficutly getting into a good restaurant if
we wait too long. Also, I think I am just a little
excited about the trip!
Luv to all
Liz

The Verdict
The highest of the city's high-society restaurants.

Tip Sheet
One of New York's Best
Nominated for best dessert and for best French
restaurant, this aptly-named restaurant provides the
city's most carnivalesque dinner experience.
Can't Wait?
Peruse Le Cirque 2000's blockbuster wine list now.

Also Nominated for Best French Restaurant
Daniel, Chanterelle, Jean Georges, Le Bernardin

Also Nominated for Best Dessert
Gramercy Tavern, Payard Patisserie, Jean Georges, Park
Avenue Cafe

The Scene
Uber-designer Adam Tihany's (Jean Georges, among
others) surreal interior evokes simultaneous thoughts
of the Sistine Chapel and ""The Jetsons."" Purple,
one-armed velvet chairs, neon tubing and
stainless-steel sculptures compete for attention with
the soaring, gilded ceilings, pre-Raphaelite murals
and bejeweled patrons. Ringleader Sirio Maccioni
oversees a front-of-house that has won praise for
softening the haughty edge that marked the
restaurant's pre-Y2K incarnation.

The Food
Still some of the most sublime haute cuisine around.
Though longtime sous chef Sotta Kuhnn is now heading
the kitchen=01*having succeeded Sylvain Portay (who took
over for Daniel Boulud)=01*the luxurious,
truffle-and-foie-gras-studded fare remains as sharp as
ever. The current menu includes the long-running
paupiette of sea bass with Barolo sauce and leeks, as
well a sauteed veal chop with bacon-wrapped asparagus.
Patrons can take decision-making out of the picture
entirely with the five-course chef's degustation menu,
a bargain at $90.

Hi Kenny: Bonny sent me your E-mail address and
so I am trying it out. Sorry we could not make it
to the party. The temperature is very warm here
in Kansas today. I checked Enron stock recently
and it looks like it is doing fine. I am
particularly interested in your venture into the
fiber optics communications business and the
windpower. We sold our interest in the Cellular
business last year and I think the land line
company will be sold soon. We sold to Allied
Telephone Coimpany of Little Rock. Two other
engineers and myself put Kansas Cellular together
about 14 years ago. Then we built a fiber system
from East to West across Kansas. That was sold
with the Cellular. Take care of yourself-Loyal

It is even worse than the stealth tax increase in  '96 because it cuts to the 
heart of voters' objections to the funding of sports  facilities. And it 
takes away our reponse that this money cannot legally ever be  used to fund 
hospitals or education. This was the basis of their successful  attack in 
'99---only this time we don't have any real response.

I have met and discussed the possibility of the GV replacing a 900B or a 
total fleet transition at length with John Stabler, Ron Fain and Keith 
Jones.  I have prepared a spread sheet showing the affect on budget as well 
as our thoughts and recommendations.
  
Although the cabin size of the Global Express is larger, Gulfstream is a good 
two years ahead of the Global in deliveries and fleet size.  They have 
overcome the mechanical problems that were experienced earlier in the 
program,  problems that  the Global Express may still be facing.  Worldwide 
support and operational experience have the Gulfstream far ahead of the 
Global Express.

I  had  the  misfortune  recently  of listening to your presentation at the 
AIPN
conference in Cape Town, South Africa. I had to leave immediately following 
your
talk , otherwise I would have challenged you about the contents of you talk. 
You
used  this  opportunity  to  criticise  bankers  (lenders)  as  you  called 
them
referring  to  them  as  quote ""concrete shoes"" and also criticised 
para-statals
commenting that ""they never offer to buy you lunch."" Such idiotic references 
are
not  what  I would expect from an officer of Enron Corporation. Although your 
cv
indicates  that infact you are part of Merrill International. It is not clear 
if
you are also an officer of Enron.

I  as  a  Director of HSBC Investment Bank , plus my UK and RSA based 
colleagues
have over recent years spent a considerable amount of time and money  
performing
various  studies  for  Enron  iro  the proposed MISP and gas export project 
plus
Project ""Sunshine"" etc.  HSBC have not billed Enron for any of this work.

I  had the pleasure of meeting  Dr Ken Lay at CERA in February and amongst 
other
things  he  referred  to  the  various  problems  Enron had experienced wrt 
this
project  and  stated  that quote  ""Enron do not build steel plants.""  This 
clear
and  honest  comment  from  your  boss  is  welcome  and  this is indeed 
Enron's
prerogative.  What  I  object  to  frankly  is a presentation that maintains 
the
pretence  of a project and seeks to blame third parties such as lenders and 
para
statal organisations for difficulties you may have experienced.

I suggest that it is in everyone's interest to speak openely and 
constructively.
I  for one have no problem at all Enron saying that their future is in 
broadband
and not in steel plants in Mozambique.

If  anyone  is  interested in my own views as to how things could have been 
done
differently out here I would be delighted to let you  or Dr Lay know.

Yours sincerely,

Philip Rhind

professorship honoring Pinkney Walker.  I'm delighted that you plan to
attend the Davenport Society banquet on October 13.

The purpose of this e-mail, which Rosalee suggested as the most efficient
way of reaching you, is two-fold:

     1. To seek your endorsement of naming the new professorship the Pinkney
C. Walker Distinguished Teaching Professorship.  Rather than designating the
professorship for Business and Economics, for Business Theory, or for some
other area, I'd like to use it to recognize and reward a faculty member in
the College of Business who is especially known for teaching effectiveness.
Both Bob Pugh and Ralph Clark endorse this approach; I have a call into
Harold Hook to seek his input.

A few points of elaboration:
     * ""Distinguished"" is a standard adjective in the titles of such
positions.
     * We will use a committee of faculty and administrators within the
college to select the recipient of the professorship, subject to my
approval.
     * And, I don't know if we will have the recipient selected by October
13.

This name for the professorship (1) coincides with Pinkney's great strength,
(2) allows me to avoid any ""turf battles"" (either within the college or with
Economics) and (3) underscores the great importance of teaching in the
college.  Please let me know whether you are agreeable to this name.

     2. To ask you to serve as the keynote speaker for the Davenport Society
banquet on October 13.  We would be honored if you would present a brief
talk (perhaps 10 minutes in length) related to some aspect of the future of
business.  Your doing so would certainly add luster to an always festive
event.  By way of brief background, Jack and Mary Bush, MU alumni who now
live in Dallas and are co-chairs of the Davenport Society this year, have
chosen the future of business as the theme for the banquet and program.
Your talk would come after dinner and could be preceded or followed
(probably followed) by the announcement of the Pinkney Walker Professorship.
I understand from Rosalee that you will be giving a talk in Austin the
morning of October 13; perhaps an abridged version of it would be suitable
for the Davenport Society banquet.  Of course, you have great latitude in
choosing the topic you would like to address.  Please let me know if you
will serve as the keynote speaker.

If you can give me quick responses to these 2 requests, we will complete the
plans for the evening, which will include the annoucement of the Pinkney
Walker Professorship and, I hope, a keynote address by you.  Naturally, if
you have questions, either you or Rosalee can call me.  My office # is
573/882-6688, and my home # is 573/875-2972.

Let me close by mentioning that there was some question as to whether or not
Pinkney would attend the banquet on October 13.  Apparently he had/has been
experiencing some health problems.  However, the latest I've heard is that
he intends to attend, due in large part to your commitment to be there.
Time permitting, you might want to give him a quick call to tell him you'll
see him here in Columbia on October 13.  (By the way, if Pinkney and his
wife arrive on October 12, I will invite them to attend an informal dinner I
will host that evening for members of the college's advisory board.  Of
course, you are invited to attend the dinner on October 12 as well, but it's
my understanding that you will fly to Columbia on October 13.)

Ken, thanks very much.  I hope and trust that you had an ample dose of ""R&R""
during your vacation.  I look forward to hearing from you.",LAY-K

Subject: Referendum Campaign


Mr. Lay--

I have been assisting John Watson with his representation of Sports
Facilities, L.P., and I am in the process of coordinating the $1.4 million
prepayment by the Sports Authority and the contribution of such amount by
the partners to the referendum campaign.

Assuming that we receive the prepayment from the Sports Authority, we expect
to be able to start making contributions to the referendum campaign this
week.  The contributions will be paid to the referendum campaign by the
partnership, on behalf of each partner, upon receipt of instructions from
each such partner that its share of the amount prepaid should be contributed
to the campaign instead of being distributed.  I have discussed this
procedure with Sue Walden.

With respect to your arrangement with Shell, we were not sure what you and
Shell had agreed to.  The monies being contributed to the referendum
campaign are being contributed to a special purpose political action
committee (as required by law).  This special purpose PAC is subject to the
general Texas laws that govern campaign fundraising.  As you know, one of
these laws provides that ""a person may not knowingly make or authorize a
political contribution in the name of or on behalf of another unless the
person discloses in writing to the recipient the name and address of the
person actually making the contribution . . . .""   Pending a better
understanding of the Shell arrangement, we will hold Shell's $100,000 in the
partnership's account.

Please contact John Watson at 713-758-2556 or me at 713-758-2350 if you have
any questions regarding the foregoing.

Sincerely,

Michael S. Telle

Subject: Gerald Smith

Over the past few months, Enron Global Finance has been evaluating various 
opportunities where Enron and Smith Graham & Company may be able to work 
together.  Unfortunately, the process was slowed when our primary contact at 
Smith Graham, Gabriel Hayes, left the firm earlier this year.  We have since 
reestablished discussions and the Global Finance Group is preparing a 
proposal that a portion (about $30 million) of the Enron Cash Balance Plan 
portfolio be dedicated to an emerging managers portfolio.  One-third of this 
money ($10 million) would be invested in bonds, which could be placed with 
Smith Graham, as the fixed-income manager .  (Total Plan assets are about 
$235 million.)

The proposal will be submitted to the Plan Administrative Committee at its 
quarterly meeting on May 3rd.  The proposal should be well received as the 
Committiee has previously requested that  we optimize our existing allocation 
to minority money managers.  Gerald Smith has been advised that Enron is 
looking at ways to allocate money to the firm, and that a decision should be 
reached sometime in May.  We have not communicated the specific details of 
our intentions as of yet pending the outcome of the May 3rd meeting.

I am available for further discussion at your convenience.

Tim DeSpain

From : Gavyn Davies, Goldman Sachs

Re - The Global Oil Price Shock


Since our meeting in Houston, the spike in world oil prices has gripped the
attention of financial markets. I attach a paper which analyses the genesis
of the present oil price increase, the likelihood of it proving permanent,
and the probable impact on the world economy.

The bottom line is the following:

1. The recent increase in the oil price has been due fundamentally to
an increase in global demand, and not to the activities of OPEC, operating
as an oil cartel. In fact, OPEC does not seem to have enough immediate
supply headroom to make much difference to the situation for many months.
The danger of shortages will therefore be very acute this winter, even with
normal weather conditions. This could lead to temporary spikes in the price
to well over $40/barrel. We see a similar situation, or worse, developing in
natural gas.

2. However, we do not see this situation as permanent. In terms of deep
fundamentals, the equilibrium price for oil in the long term is still only
about $18/barrel. Within about 12 months, a large increase in the supply of
oil should push prices back down again, possibly quite sharply. Our present
forecast for the average oil price in 2001 is $27/barrel, somewhat below
today's spot price levels. But we do not expect to see this oil price
downturn before next summer.

3. If oil prices do indeed average $27/bl in 2001, this will prove to
be an oil shock for the developed economies which is the same in magnitude
as the Gulf War shock a decade ago. It will reduce net disposable income for
the OECD economies by about 0.7%, and add about 0.9% to headline inflation
numbers. All of these effects will already be in the data by about 2000 Q4,
so on our main forecast there should be little or no further adverse effects
through 2001.

4. On this oil price scenario, GDP growth in the developed economies
will slow from about 3.9% in 2000 to about 3.4% in 2001 - not a bad
out-turn.

5. What if the oil price sustains $40/bl next year? This would give us
another round of effects about the same as those mentioned in para (3)
above. Even then, however, these effects should not be enough to push the
world into recession. Growth should still be adequate at about 2.5-3.0%.

6. The main risks to this conclusion are that a spike in oil prices,
and possible oil shortages, this winter cause a drop in equity prices, and a
large dip in business and consumer confidence. This could then lead to a
more pronounced downturn in GDP next year, especially if it triggers the
kind of correction in the US that Larry and I have been worrying about for a
long time. But this should prove just about avoidable, assuming sensible
policy responses..

7. This may therefore all work out a bit like the winter of 1998/99.
Going into the winter, events occur which make people worry about recession.
Business and consumer confidence, and equity markets, take a dip. But then
things improve, and it all turns out to be a buying opportunity.

8. I hope so, anyway!

Gavyn

THE HILL REPORT
A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions
Week of September 30 - October 6, 2000


This Week in Washington, the United States House of Representatives
continued its work on the appropriations process for funding of the
fiscal year of 2001.  The House passed the conference reports on
the energy, interior and transportation appropriations bills.   We
also passed a continuing resolution agreement that will keep the
government running until all 13 appropriations bills are passed and
signed into law by the president.

On Monday of this week, as Chairman of the Congressional Results
Caucus and a member of the Congressional Cyber Security Caucus, I
toured the high-tech corridor of Boston, Massachusetts today to learn
about high-tech issues such as information security, e-signature
legislation and Internet taxation.

I organized the trip to draw attention to the need for more implementation
of information technology security not only among federal and other
governmental agencies but in the private sector as well.  The Congressional
Cyber Security Caucus exists in part to educate other members of
Congress and government agencies of the vital need for secure information
technology systems.

The trip came on the heels of a recent General Accounting Office
(GAO) report to Congress that clearly stated that too many government
operations and assets remain at risk of cyber attack.  The GAO discovered
serious security flaws at major federal agencies such as the Treasury
Department and the Department of Defense - situations clearly indicating
large potential threats to citizen privacy and national security.

Some of the computer systems that run our national defense and military
operations are literally an open target to hostile nations or terrorists
who have cyber terrorism technology.  Both accidental and intentional
attacks on these very systems have been detected and we must take
steps to stop them.

I was joined by Rules Committee Chairman David Dreier (R-CA), Congressman
Tom Davis (R-VA), Congressman Pete Hoekstra (R-MI), Congresswoman
Nancy Johnson (R-CT), Congressman John Sununu (R-NH), Congressman
Jack Quinn (R-NY), Congressman John Sweeney (R-NY), and other prominent
business, community and financial leaders.

We attended a meeting at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
with area CEOs and high-tech leaders, representing the financial,
communications and technology community.  The discussion was hosted
by TechNet Massachusetts to discuss creating digital opportunities,
H-1B visas, protection of online privacy, and taxation of Internet
transactions.

I believe that any government agency using information systems and
is linked to the outside world MUST have an efficient and secure
information security system.  The potential privacy and security
threat is not something we should take lightly and unfortunately
too many high-level government officials are doing just that!

Any major business, industry or government organization must consider
the threat of cyber attack and how it could be a devastating situation
to customers and citizens.  I can't imagine any of my constituents
being interested in having their private banking information being
made public to anyone on the Internet.  Security and privacy must
be a priority and the businesses and organizations that possess this
sensitive information can not afford the risk of intrusion.

Members also met with high-tech officials, Governor Paul Cellucci
(R-MA), and Lt. Governor Jane Swift (R-MA) to discuss the future
of the information technology industry as well as pending legislation
in Congress designed to address the pressing needs of New Economy
companies.

Earlier this year, I digitally signed the ""The e-Contract 2000"" with
high-tech America to renew his commitment to promoting the New Economy
in the 21st century.

I pledge to continue my legislative and oversight efforts to remove
the barriers to future innovation, competition, and growth.  Freedom
is the answer, not government intervention.
The New Economy has created limitless opportunities in America today
for consumers, companies and workers alike.

The e-Contract 2000 outlines a number of policies the Republican-controlled
Congress has designed to promote continued growth in the New Economy,
such as ""Reducing Taxation, Regulation, and Litigation"" and ""Promoting
Free Trade and E-Commerce.""

Also this year I voted for continued growth in the new economy by
supporting the ""Internet Non-Discrimination Act"" (H.R. 3709), to
extend the current Internet tax moratorium for an additional 5 years,
through 2006.  The bill passed in the U.S. House of Representatives
by a vote of 352-75.

The tremendous growth of e-commerce has created thousands of high-wage
jobs in this country and has led to countless new choices for Texas
consumers.  The group with me today believes the New Economy should
remain unfettered by burdensome taxes and regulation, to ensure continued
growth and innovation into the 21st century.

Around Texas...

Last Friday, I spoke to the advanced placement Government and Economics
classes at Palestine High School.  I pointed out to them that our
Constitutional form of government is really just an on-going experiment,
and that the continued success of our country depends on the participation
of all of our citizens.  I told them that I am confident that we
can solve every problem in America.  I always enjoy speaking with
enthusiastic young people, and I want to give every student an opportunity
to experience and understand our government.

On Saturday I went to the St. Thomas - Aquinas children's carnival,
and that evening I attended a fundraising event to benefit ""For the
Love of the Lake.""  This is one of my favorite community projects.
 I have adopted part of the shoreline of White Rock Lake, and would
encourage all of you to come help out at our ""Second Saturday Clean-up.""
 See my web site for more information.

Tomorrow I will see my friends in Anderson County at the Anderson
County Cattle Baron's Ball.  And in two weeks, I will be in Bryan
for a Town Hall Meeting.  See the notice at the end of this e-mail.

Next week Congress is hoping to finish its work on the budget for
fiscal year 2001.

Have a great weekend! - Pete

New Radio Ad Slams Corzine Dishonesty 
Surrounding Questionable Financial Dealings

Washington, DC -- Calling the campaign of liberal New Jersey Democrat Senate 
candidate Jon Corzine, ""a cynical and manipulative effort to deceive New 
Jersey voters about Corzine's questionable and mysterious financial 
dealings,"" Mark Miller, Executive Director of the Republican Leadership 
Council (RLC) announced the release of a new radio ad that begins airing this 
morning throughout New Jersey. 

The text of the 60-second radio ad, entitled ""Dodge,"" is as follows: 

Announcer: 

Money can buy multi-millionaire Jon Corzine a lot, but it can't buy New 
Jersey's trust... he must earn it.? And that's a problem for Jon Corzine. 
? 
According to recent news reports, Jon Corzine is having trouble with the 
truth. 

Corzine and his supporters were asked if Jon Corzine had contributed to their 
organizations prior to receiving their political endorsements.? The answer 
was ""no"". 

Now, Corzine's own records indicate his foundation did give one of the groups 
a contribution.? Corzine responded that the contribution came before he 
announced his candidacy.? But Corzine's own records revealed that he made the 
contribution after he announced his candidacy.? Corzine said the tax exempt 
contribution was for an after school program.? But the group's leader said 
that Corzine knew the contribution was for a political office. 

Call Jon Corzine at 973/643-0500.? Tell him trust is something money can't 
buy.? Paid for by the Republican Leadership Council. 

?Said Miller: ""Jon Corzine has created his own campaign problems by 
continuing to shroud his financial past in secrecy.? Mr. Corzine's vast 
wealth has allowed him to buy a record number of slick political ads, but if 
he thinks he can simply purchase the trust of New Jerseyans, he's in for a 
very unpleasant surprise.""

In my pre-Enron life, I taught history (years and years ago).  

Recently, while culling files in preparation for moving from EB to 3AC,  I 
came across a pamphlet about the origins of the Transwestern Pipeline Company 
and found it very interesting - for the second or third time.

In particular, I am impressed by the vision these pioneers had.  My concern 
is that our Enron preserve some record of those early people and days of the 
entities that make up the bigger Enron.  They were awesome.

In another pre-Enron segment of my life, I worked for a rare and out-of-print 
book dealer.  One of the collections we worked hard to accumulate and then to 
sell as a collection was a group of business histories.  The collection was 
snapped up the first month we put it on the market.  Great business stories 
go on and on being researched by and inspiring new generations of 
entrepreneurs.

Not having practiced my craft as historian for many years, I am no longer 
familiar with the important names in historical writing (except for popular 
historians such as Stephen Ambrose).  If Enron doesn't already have a 
historian, we need an established writer of substantial stature - someone 
whose produced work would reach a lot of people.  

Maybe someone from the Rice University staff could point the way?  Or, maybe 
even someone from Rice has the qualities needed to produce an exciting 
history of Enron.

Because ours is such a great story, I would like to see a project such as 
this pursued.  I would like to know what you think about this suggestion.

Thanks for letting me send this your way.

Subject: Invitation to deliver 2001 IAEE conference keynote


Dear Ken:

Next April 25-27, 2001, Houston will host the 24th conference of the
International Association for Energy Economics, in combination with the
annual meeting of our U.S. Association for Energy Economics affiliate.  We
invite you to serve as our opening keynote speaker at the kick off luncheon
on Wednesday, April 25 to help set the tone, goals and objectives for this
event.

Our theme is ""2001: An Energy Odyssey."" We are using the conference to
showcase the role of economics in developing markets for energy, and to
deal with issues that impede, or facilitate, market development as well as
enterprise strategy and metamorphosis.  We can think of no one better to
clearly define these major themes and priorities than you.

I was a speaker and delegate at the World Forum on Energy Regulation in
Montreal last May, and greatly enjoyed your luncheon keynote (and hope that
the regulators and policy makers attending the Forum took your key points t=
o
heart).  The thoughts you offered -- on the importance of standards, the
opportunities to build network platforms and Enron's own experience, are of
vital importance to IAEE/USAEE members.  We would ask you to include
comments on the fundamental importance of economic principles in both
guiding market development and the efforts of those of us who operate in
markets on behalf of enterprises.

The IAEE remains the largest worldwide combination of industry, business an=
d
university interests engaged in energy development and policy.  To bring yo=
u
up-to-date on the association, our Web site is www.iaee.org. I'm sure
Rosilea will have someone on her staff pull the relevant materials together
for you. I have also included the call for papers for the Houston conferenc=
e
(at the end of this mail) which lines out the major sessions and topics. In
addition to our invitation to you, we are inviting Mark Moody-Stuart of
RD/Shell for the April 26 keynote luncheon to address environmental issues
and Rilwanu Lukman, Secretary General of OPEC (and a member of IAEE), in a
joint session with the Board of Directors of the Offshore Technology
Conference on Friday, to cover worldwide outlooks for oil and gas.

Finally, as you know, Enron Corp. for some time has been a corporate
sponsor of our UH Energy Institute and the previous Natural Gas Project,
which you helped to found.  Thus, we also are relying on Rob Bradley to hel=
p
identify and implement the major environmental themes for the plenary
session, ""Sustaining Development"" (yes, we indeed are trying to turn
thinking around with our re-phrasing).

I hope to hear from Rosilea soon on your interest and availability.  We
look forward to having you with us next April!

Gentlemen,

Technology For All (TFA)received today our 501(c)(3) exemption letter
from the IRS.  This letter gives us the opportunity to vigorously
pursue new funding opportunities and also validates what we have known
all along. TFA is a charitable organization serving the underserved in
communities across the US.

We thank Jack Clark, our general counsel, for his arduous pro-bono
legal work over the past 15 months that helped make this happen.
THANKS JACK!!!

On another note, each of you should have received word from Rosemarie
Foster, TFA's Administrative Assistant, regarding a Technology For All
Board meeting scheduled for Tuesday, May 8, 2001 at the University
Hilton on the University of Houston Campus.  The meeting will take
place at 2:00 PM and conclude by 3:30 PM.  It will take place in the
context of an all-day Technology For All sponsored conference ""Digital
Divide: A Call to Action"".  Each of you will receive an complimentary
invitation to the activities of the day.  Ken Lay will be hosting a
CEO breakfast at 8:00 am.  Our purpose there will be to tell the TFA
story and invite the CEO's present to make a commitment to help TFA
eliminate the digital divide across Houston and beyond.  At lunch,
Greg Priest, CEO of SmartForce, will be speaking. SmartForce recently
gave TFA access to all its online eLearning content.  This gift will
allow TFA to provide workforce training opportunities to half a
million persons over the next three years.  We will thank SmartForce
during the luncheon for their enormous gift which has a retail value
that could be as high as nine figures (depending on the number of
courses utilized).

Regards,

Will

Subject: Governors Conference




Dear Ken, 

It was good to talk with you last week, and I hope you got some vacation in 
Aspen.? I'm working at it! 

Rosalie said you'd be getting in this afternoon, and I? wanted to reach you 
by phone or e-mail before Governor Tony Knowles from Alaska calls you.? 
Governor Knowles (classmate of George W.), along with Governor Taft of Ohio, 
has enlisted us in a conference that seven governors are sponsoring on 
natural gas in order to elucidate the market and issues -- and needs -- 
before it explodes as a political issue -- and perhaps helps head it off (in 
contrast to what happened with gasoline).? Governor Knowles is the current 
chairman of the Interstate Oil Compact Commission, and it will be under the 
auspices of the IOCC.? They promise at least seven governors and a lot of 
other distinguished people.? It seems to us that this is a very timely event.

They would like to invite you to be the luncheon speaker.? (I will be kicking 
off the conference).?? It looks to be a very good and high visibility 
platform.? And they would be very keen and excited -- and honored -- to have 
you in that featured role in it works for your schedule.

It takes place in Columbus, Ohio, on September 20. 

Tony is a very good guy, and of course natural gas as well as oil looms very 
large for him.? You'll enjoy talking with him.? He can certainly fill you in 
further on what they would like to accomplish.

If it works out for you to do this in terms of your schedule and interest, 
that would be great. 

On behalf of the governors, thank you for the consideration. 

Best, 

Dan

Harry (or, again, should I address you as ""Houston's Sugar Daddy"" as  they

at the ADL luncheon) 

I am going to take about 1/2 of my  golf clubs to Europe on the coming trip.

Mick will probably take  his 5 iron. ?If you and Ken take your clubs then we 
could have fun,  exchange money, and get some exercise together. 

In this regard, since  you are the student of golf courses everywhere why 
don't you extract from  some of your library of golf books some suggested 
courses to play. If you  do not have this info in your library I will be glad 
to work on this.  

Also, and the real point of this e-mail, I want to ask you to  do something 
for all of us. I need to know the exact names of the courses  we have played 
on previous trips. I know you saved ball markers etc  from each course and my 
old brain does not remember these course names. As  you well know, I normally 
""tear up"" score cards after each match.  ??I ask you to do this for a reason. 
? 
I have a little gift  for each golfer that will serve as a record of courses 
played by us, but I  need the names of the past ones played. ?There is no 
rush 
on this  request. ?If you will do this, simply bring the list to the 
airplane:  
you can give this info to me after take off on May 29th. ?If you do  not have 
this info at your ""finger tips,"" so be it, we will simply ""wing  it."" 

Hope all is well with you and Macey. ?Brenda and I will see  you guys at the

week 
from Saturday, if not before.

Thanks for your reply to my 20 trip rules

Yes, Brenda and I are already planning our next group trip ( however, we have
only been able to obtain 7 confirmations but not to worry, Macey is included
and I will make videos for you if we are unable to confirm space for you too.)

As to ""no other fool would walk with you in the morning,"" have you considered
a deaf person might enjoy walks with you.

And, Brenda and I go as a ""package"" so when you think of Brenda you cannot
help but include me....sorry.

Finally, as to the spelling your name in the letter, my secretary made the
mistake when she retyped what Brenda and I wrote and faxed and E-mailed it to
all.  We would never miss the spelling of your name because we have always
thought it was a dichotomy that your last name included ""reason.""

you say, even the hint of the slightest committement, against Enron in the 
future. As you know, I have found this group the most dishonest, back 
dealing  NGO I have ever dealt with.When Shell has these meetings, they have 
my counterpart meet ahead of time with the the WWF top staff person and work 
out an agenda. For example, you will have to be throughly briefed on the 
Bolivian situation before we go in.  I also would find it counter productive 
to include any of the low level WWF staff that went to this meeting when 
Shell held it last.   Remember, this is the group that publicly announced 
that Enron has gotten away with murder for years and we are going to get 
them.  They also have te goal of wanting to lock us up in a world wide 
partnership. This is the last groupo I would do this with.

I guess this is a long way of saying that we need to go in their well 
prepared with our eyes wide open. Did you commit to any agenda when you set 
up the meeting? I will contact their staff and see what they want to discuss

ENRON ANOUNCES EMPLOYEE PROGRAM
On October 5, Enron announced ""it will give employees of its wholly owned
subsidiaries a high-speed computer and Internet connection, including
broadband connectivity, for use at home, beginning in 2001.   .......Through
a company-wide computer drive, employees will be able to donate their
existing home computers to Technology For All (www.techforall.org) , a
national program working to bridge the digital divide.""   Technology For All
thanks Ken Lay for his leadership in this decision that also helps TFA serve
America's underserved and disadvantaged.
For more information, the full press release is located at
http://www4.enron.com/corp/pr/releases/2000/ene/87-PC-Enron.html .


$45 MILLION SMARTFORCE DONATION TO BE ANNOUNCED NOVEMBER 15
On November 15 TFA and SmartForce
(http://www.smartforce.com/corp/marketing/default.htm ) will post a joint
press release announcing the donation of 450,000 scholarships for SmartForce
eLearning courses to be delivered through the TFA secure website to end
users seeking training with TFA collaborative program partners across the
US.  The 600 online courses available through the program are in English and
Spanish and include everything from computer basics to various levels of
technical certification. This generous gift to TFA will be utilized over a
three year period and has a retail value of approximately $45 million. A key
component of the gift will be the inclusion of a ""SmartJobs"" section on the
web site that will list companies doing business with SmartForce that have
pledged to interview job applicants who successfully complete training
through a TFA/SmartForce course. Scott Yeager will call Greg Priest, CEO of
Smarforce, on behalf of TFA and thank him for this generous gift toward the
Technology For All initiative.

AMERICA CONNECTS CONSORTIUM
TFA is working with the America Connects Consortium (ACC) to help support
Community Technology Centers across the US. The ACC received recently
received a $2 million Department of Education  grant to support CTC efforts.
The benefits to TFA include program support for existing TFA programs and
the ability to share best practices across the US. The consortium will
assist TFA in its city by city model by helping encourage exisiting
organizations to work together. In addition to sharing TFA online content
TFA will also host online curriculum resources created by the consortium on
the private side of our web site.  The work of the Consortium will begin
with an organizational meeting in Boston, November 15-16.  For more
information read the full release posted on the TFA web site at.
http://www.techforall.org/showdoc.cfm?id=35&ret=new

BLUECURRENT RELATIONSHIP FINALIZED
TFA recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Bluecurrent.  Through
the relationship Bluecurrent will assist TFA with the management and
donation of corporate technology assets across the US.  Through the creative
use of donated assets as ""currency"" the Bluecurrent relationship will save
TFA $13.5 million in projected cash expenses over the next five years to
process and redeploy corporate technology assets donated to TFA.  In
addition, we believe this relationship will dramatically increase the
computers available to TFA and its program partners.  For more information
about Bluecurrent go to http://www.bluecurrent.com .

LINCT COALITION ""LEARN AND EARN"" PROGRAM TO EMPOWER
One of the beneficiaries of the Bluecurrent relationship will be the ability
of TFA to more quickly rollout the TFA/LINCT coalition ""Learn and Earn""
Program. This program will allow disadvantaged persons who participate in
the program to learn how to use a computer and then mentor another person
using the same curriculum. By completing both parts of this cross-age peer
tutoring program, participants will then ""earn"" a computer to take home,
thus creating new opportunities for education and economic empowerment.
More information about the LINCT coalition ""learn and earn"" program can be
found at http://www.linct.org/

DIGITAL DIVIDENDS CONFERENCE, SEATTLE
Two weeks ago I attended the Digital Dividends Conference in Seattle.  The
focus of the Conference was ""creating digital dividends"" and exploreing
innovative approaches to closing the global digital divide.  The conference
was hosted by the World Resources Institute, chaired by William D.
Ruckelshaus, and reviewed business modesl and market development strategies
to close the digital divide.  I made several important connections at the
conference including key personnel with Hewlett Packard.  Carly Fiorina,
HP's CEO, announced a huge global initiative by Hewlett Packard to address
the digital divide in 1000 villages across the world.

ASIA FOUNDATION RELATIONSHIP BEING DEVELOPED
Through the introduction of Enron lobbyist David Merrill, former ambassador
to Bangladesh during the Bush adminstration, TFA met last week with the
President and several staff members of the Asia Foundation. The Asia
Foundation supports economic development and other efforts in Asia and is
funded by private contributions and the US State Department. The Asia
Foundation indicated an interest in working together with TFA in the future
as Enron expands its backbone to Japan and other Asian countries.

LAY AND TROTTER ASSIST IN FUNDRAISING EFFORTS
TFA and its local affiliate Technology For All-Houston are working together
to follow through on grant requests of $5 million over a three year period
from Houston area foundations.  We have had initially o\positive responses
from Houston Endowment and the Brown Foundation as well as several smaller
foundations including the Hamman Foundation and the Sterling Turner
Foundation. We are also preparing requests to Houston area corporations and
friends of TFA that will go out in the next few weeks.  A bridge loan from
the Redstone bank has been secured to get us through the next couple of
months. TFA anticipates a need for $4.5 million in cash over the next twelve
months to help us build capacity and long term sustainability.  With the
creative business relationships being created we expect to be able to insure
sustainability of the organization after the initial capacity is secured.
However, until that time, TFA will be dependent upon the cash and in-kind
contributions of foundations, corporations, its board members and friends.

PROGRESS CONTINUES ON IVERCITY DEAL
The IverCity ""deal"" is an example of an innovative and creative solution for
long-term sustainability.  Through the co-branding of the TFA/IverCity web
site, we hope to drive web users to IverCity content and thus create the
potential for a IverCity liquidity event that will benefit TFA's long term
capital needs.  Jack Clark has done a superb job creating the draft of the
legal document outlining the deal.  We thank Jack Trotter for his suggestion
to create a convertible royalty rather than just equity by itself.  The
benefit to TFA is the ability for TFA to be compensated by the number of
users we direct to the IverCity content which will be useful to TFA
constituents.

ROSEMARIE FOSTER TO JOIN TFA AS ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT
Effective, November 20, Rosemarie Foster will be joining the TFA staff
fulltime as administrative assistant.  She will begin working some partime
hours this week. Thanks to Jack Trotter and Jack Clark for providing office
space for Rosemarie.  Additional TFA staff are being c\interviewed to assist
with fund-raising, program development, web site development and network
infrastructure support.

DISCUSSIONS WITH INTERNET POLICY INSTITUTE
Justin Cornett represented TFA recently at a ""town hall"" meeting of the
Internet Policy Institute (IPI) in Austin.  The IPI will be working with TFA
in our Washington DC rollout. We will be meeting with them again next week
in DC. We thank Ken Lay for his initial introductions to the board members
and staff of the IPI.

NEW YORK, LOS ANGELES, WASHINGTON DC, SAN DIEGO, ATLANTA
Through introductions from TFA board members and others we are beginning to
develop key contacts in each of the cities noted above. Board assistance
will be required as we also seek to develop co-branding corporate
relationships.  As per the wishes of the board, we are focused on New York,
Washington DC, and Los Angeles first.  We will keep you posted and request
your assistance as appropriate.

ROAD-SHOW.COM DONATES WEBCAST PRODUCTION
Road-Show.com, an Enron customer, recently donated a webcast for TFA to
utilize on its website.  The url for the site is listed below and will soon
be accessible from TFA's web site as well.

Is located at: survey.enron.com


Top 10 Reasons You Should Fill Out The Pulse Survey:
10. This is one time silence isn't golden.
9. Those pesky flashing red lights are trained to come back on until you fill 
it out.
8. 50% response rate.  3 days left to go.  You do the math.
7. Despite what you may think, the survey results don't just go spinning into 
cyberspace.  There are action teams in operation all around Enron whose sole 
mission is to resolve problems that are identified in the survey feedback.
6. It's free!  (And very easy, too.)
5. You have a right to remain silent.  But if you give up that right, we may 
be able to help you.
4. For the 15 minutes you're filling it out, you don't have to work!
3. You can say what you really feel about your job and Enron without fear, 
because the survey is completely confidential.
2. Do you really want that other business unit one-upping you in 
participation numbers?
And the number one reason you (yes, you) should fill out The Pulse:
1. We're going to keep sending these emails until we have 100% participation.",LAY-K

(PaineWebber) PW.? We have about another $5 million  available with a little 
bit of cushion.? I also spoke with Rocky about how  they arrive at their loan 
to value calculations and he is going to have me talk  with the person in 
that department to walk me through it.? Regardless of  how much that number 
moves, I told Sherrie that you would like to know where it  stands at the 
time she provides the information for all of the other  lines.? I told her 
that we should have that updated once a  week.
?
I also?thought it would be good?within  the?partnership to borrow against the 
PW accounts, which include Fayez,  Cypress, Eagle, and Harris Bretall for 
some of these private investments.?  The combined gross value is at $2.5 
million so that would allow for an  additional $1.25 million to be borrowed 
at 50% loan to value.? It may be a  higher number, but with a small cushion 
that is probably a good estimate.?  I talked to Rocky about this and he said 
it would be no problem and he would  give us the same rate 70 basis points.
?
With regards to rates and the PW/UBS merger, Rocky  said that he thinks that 
he can get our borrowing rate down from 70 basis points  plus LIBOR to 20 
basis points plus LIBOR come this November when the merger is  completed.
?
I have Rocky working on much better reports, like  that which was provided to 
be by Mueller/O'Shaughnessy at MSDW.? I told him  that they needed to work on 
what they have?been providing to me.? I  have not been impressed with the 
last couple of reports he has produced so that  is why you haven't seen 
them.? Rocky informed me that?he has sense  gone out and purchased a better 
system for that purpose.
?
I also told him that I would like an update on the  performance reports that 
are run on managers, specifically ours.?  Also,?I am having him include 
managers that invest in Latin America.?  I though it would be good, since 
Robert Day of TCW has been positive about  that?geographic area.
?
With regards to any future selling of personal  Enron stock, Rocky recommends 
selling within your?retirment plan since the  taxes are deferred and 
diversify within it.? Maybe set-up some of the  managed accounts here.? I 
inquired about the Enron 401(k) plan?with  regards to any additional choices 
to be offered.? He said that he?was  in talks with the people at Enron who 
handle it, but nothing would probably  happen anytime soon.? I don't know if 
that meant he was implying a need for  a push from?Enron's upper management?
to  make it happen.
?
I know that Sherrie is working her tail off to try  and get you the July 
Financials before your trip.? I know she is planning  on staying late to get 
it completed.? I told her that you want them before  you depart on your trip 
tomorrow.
?
I think that that is all for now.

Subject: Referendum Campaign


Mr. Lay--

During the negotiations with the Rockets as to how much each party would
contribute to the Arena referendum campaign, Mike Goldberg of Baker & Botts
suggested that the Rockets would like to net their contribution obligation
against other contributions that they solicited.

After a conversation with you, John Watson and I advised Mike Goldberg that
you did not want to be competing with the Rockets in soliciting
contributions to the Arena referendum campaign.

Mike Goldberg called Friday and asked whether it would be acceptable for the
Rockets to net against their contribution obligation contributions that they
have solicited from Baker & Botts, Jim MacInvale and Tilman Fertitta.  Mike
suggested that these three persons would be the only outside persons that
would be solicited by the Rockets.

Would you please let me know if this is acceptable to you.  You or Rosalee
may call me at 713-758-2350 or send me a response e-mail at
mtelle@velaw.com.

Sincerely,

Michael S. Telle

Just a reminder that your portfolio company presentations are due on Monday 
3/19th.  Gene will need to get his copies by mail, so please make sure Lilia 
has a copy to include in the mailing paket to him by 4PM on Monday.  If you 
are not planning to meet that deadline, please see Lilia about how you can 
get your presentation to Gene.

The first drafts were a good start.  Most, however, read more like a pitch  
[Paige, Barbara]  than an assessment/evaluation.  As you make your revisions, 
keep in mind that your objective should be to provide a succinct, but 
thorough assessment of the investment that will inform a discussion on how to 
best add value and manage the investment going forward.

If you have not gotten my feedback and would like it, we can arrange to speak 
over the weekend.  I will be traveling, but if you leave a voice message, we 
can arrange a time to speak.  I will be generally available by phone Saturday 
morning through early afternoon.

Subject: P. Walker professorship and keynote request


Thanks so much for your most generous gift to complete the funding for the
professorship honoring Pinkney Walker.  I'm delighted that you plan to
attend the Davenport Society banquet on October 13.

The purpose of this e-mail, which Rosalee suggested as the most efficient
way of reaching you, is two-fold:

     1. To seek your endorsement of naming the new professorship the Pinkney
C. Walker Distinguished Teaching Professorship.  Rather than designating the
professorship for Business and Economics, for Business Theory, or for some
other area, I'd like to use it to recognize and reward a faculty member in
the College of Business who is especially known for teaching effectiveness.
Both Bob Pugh and Ralph Clark endorse this approach; I have a call into
Harold Hook to seek his input.

A few points of elaboration:
     * ""Distinguished"" is a standard adjective in the titles of such
positions.
     * We will use a committee of faculty and administrators within the
college to select the recipient of the professorship, subject to my
approval.
     * And, I don't know if we will have the recipient selected by October
13.

This name for the professorship (1) coincides with Pinkney's great strength,
(2) allows me to avoid any ""turf battles"" (either within the college or with
Economics) and (3) underscores the great importance of teaching in the
college.  Please let me know whether you are agreeable to this name.

     2. To ask you to serve as the keynote speaker for the Davenport Society
banquet on October 13.  We would be honored if you would present a brief
talk (perhaps 10 minutes in length) related to some aspect of the future of
business.  Your doing so would certainly add luster to an always festive
event.  By way of brief background, Jack and Mary Bush, MU alumni who now
live in Dallas and are co-chairs of the Davenport Society this year, have
chosen the future of business as the theme for the banquet and program.
Your talk would come after dinner and could be preceded or followed
(probably followed) by the announcement of the Pinkney Walker Professorship.
I understand from Rosalee that you will be giving a talk in Austin the
morning of October 13; perhaps an abridged version of it would be suitable
for the Davenport Society banquet.  Of course, you have great latitude in
choosing the topic you would like to address.  Please let me know if you
will serve as the keynote speaker.

If you can give me quick responses to these 2 requests, we will complete the
plans for the evening, which will include the annoucement of the Pinkney
Walker Professorship and, I hope, a keynote address by you.  Naturally, if
you have questions, either you or Rosalee can call me.  My office # is
573/882-6688, and my home # is 573/875-2972.

Let me close by mentioning that there was some question as to whether or not
Pinkney would attend the banquet on October 13.  Apparently he had/has been
experiencing some health problems.  However, the latest I've heard is that
he intends to attend, due in large part to your commitment to be there.
Time permitting, you might want to give him a quick call to tell him you'll
see him here in Columbia on October 13.  (By the way, if Pinkney and his
wife arrive on October 12, I will invite them to attend an informal dinner I
will host that evening for members of the college's advisory board.  Of
course, you are invited to attend the dinner on October 12 as well, but it's
my understanding that you will fly to Columbia on October 13.)

Ken, thanks very much.  I hope and trust that you had an ample dose of ""R&R""
during your vacation.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Wednesday December 13 where Barton Smith of UH and George Tolley of the U. of 
Chicago will present the findings of their economic study.  The Houston Forum 
event will be part of the Kenneth L. Lay Lecture Series in Global Economics 
at the University of Houston.  (I will have a table for Enron.)

The authors presented their preliminary results to us this week, and the 
total benefits of the planned ozone reduction (all SIP measures as currently 
proposed) are below $100 million (we are indoors most of the time that bad 
air days are occurring since it is typically very hot), and the costs are 
around $5 billion out to 2010.   Lots of caveats to this conclusion including 
the assumption of today's best technology but no more.  The high costs 
include a ""last mile"" problem that the proposal of the Partnership's Business 
Coalition for Clean Air (BCCA) avoids (such as no noon-to-midnight 
construction, a 75% average point source reduction to allow for trading and 
future permits instead of a 90% reduction, etc.).

The effect on Houston is to reduce our forecast economic growth but not 
eliminate it.  Real wages are forecast to fall by some 5% or more under the 
current SIP versus without it.  Total job loss will be over 100,000--about a 
1 and a half years of growth out to 2010.   This ""shock"" will be around 
one-half of what Houston went through after the oil price crash in 1986 
according to Dr. Smith.  One might say that slower growth and spreading the 
pollution around (some of our refinery/petrochemical growth going elsewhere) 
is not the end of the world, however, if a more cost-effective SIP is chosen.

It will be several weeks before the results are final (and the election 
over), at which time an executive summary will be released.  The Mayor's 
office and TNRCC will be briefed first.  The luncheon will be the formal 
unveiling of the study with explanation, but I expect press coverage of the 
study next month.

As head of the economics working group, I have tried to ensure that a 
top-notch analysis was done without an industry bias.  The results are 
considered conservative by the authors all things considered and in line with 
the peer-reviewed literature on costs and benefits.  The study is not 
intended to be a ""whining"" study but to give us realistic expectations and to 
(naturally) bring into review some ""last mile"" problems where certain SIP 
measures are the least cost effective.

These preliminary results are confidential given the political cycle we are 
in and should not be shared externally.

Subject: Get out the Vote


Dear Friends and Family,
We are down to the wire and the race couldn't be
closer. Every vote counts, even those of you in Texas.
Please, remember to vote and go early, polls open at
7am across the country and close at 7pm but don't put
it off until 7pm as there could be lines and the
supervisors are not required to keep the polls open
after 7pm for those in line.
Remind your friends and family to vote and if someone
needs transportation to the polls, give them a ride or
call your local Victory 2000 office (Republicans) or
your local Democratic campaign office, they will have
people available to transport people to the polls.
Keep an eye out while you are at the polls for
electoral fraud and report any suspicious activity
including inappropriate campaigning to the poll
watchers at the polls. The Democrats and the
Republicans will have representatives at most of the
polls, let them know if there is suspicious activity.
Finally, if you have time, call your local offices and
offer your time to make phone calls to encourage
people to get out and vote, pass out leaflets, or to
be available to help prevent of voter fraud.

Finally, enjoy the evening and watch the results come
in. There are election watch parties everywhere!!!

Just one more day (and no more mass political e-mail's
from me and everyone else)!
Take care and VOTE!
Liz

the last breakfast meeting regarding our group financing the Arena parking
garage.  Baker & Botts put us in touch with the Rockets to discuss Hines
being the Development Manager on the Arena and garage.  Although not fully
agreed, there is strong interest on both sides.  Besides help on the
development front, we think there may be value in our acting as a bit of a
buffer between the Sports Authority and the Rockets and coordinating any
issues involving the new convention hotel(where we are also providing
development management).  The Rockets(Mike Goldberg-Baker & Botts) have
talked to Ric Campo and supposedly he is enthusiastic but thinks this
should ""be the Authority's idea."".  One issue is how much of our fee would
apply to the garage, which presumably the city would pick up, and how much
would apply to the Arena.  Since this is a fast moving issue, I wanted you
to know about this. Obviously the discussions are all very confidential.

Ken and Joe
 Jim Harmon, Chairman of EXIMBank will be in Houston March 15 and would like 
to meet with Enron to see where there are opportunities for EXIM to work more 
closely with the company.  He will be accompanied by Jeff Miller VP who 
oversees the finance operations and perhaps Barabara O""Boyle, head of the 
project finance group.  As you know we have done little with the Bank since 
Trakya. We intended to use the Bank for Dabhol 2 but were prevented to by 
sanctions imposed against India.  Joe is now on the EXIM Advisory Committee 
so it would be a good opportunity to sit down with the Bank. 
 I understand that Ken has received a letter from EXIM about the meeting and 
referred it to Joe.  I would propose that Joe lead the meeting with some of 
the regional finance people (parallel the Munoz schedule, but shorter) with a 
brief courtesy call on Ken or Ken could step in for a moment whenever he is 
available.
 I will check with Pam re Joe's availability and follow up with a memo re the 
market window initiative with EXIM where my office is heavily involved.

A New Era in Taiwan's Democracy
Monday, October 23, 2000
9:00 a.m - 3:00 p.m.
Wohlstetter Conference Center
Twelfth Floor, AEI

On May 20, Taiwan entered a new era of democracy as the torch of government 
was passed from a ruling party that has governed for the past 50 years to the 
opposition.  In the spirit of cooperation and amity, the new president 
appointed a KMT member to be his premier and sought to create an ""all 
people's government"" composed of both ruling and opposition party members.  
But that experiment ended when the premier resigned on October 3 due to bad 
health.  Now, with both a DPP president and a DPP premier at the helm, Taiwan 
enters a new era of governance and party politics.  How will this impact the 
political environment in Taiwan?  Will U.S.-Taiwan relations be affected?

(Miss Sera - would you please kindly pass on this message to Messrs.
Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling and Ken Rice)

Dear Dr. Ken Lay, Mr. Jeff Skilling and Mr.Ken Rice,

Thank you very much for meeting us on October 13.
I think Ronnie has already left you a brief message about eAccess. Let me
fill you in with some more background information about us.
I am the founder of DDI (the second largest wireline and wireless private
telecom operator in Japan). Today's DDI market capitalization is around $20
billion. I left DDI at the end of 1995 and became a professor and Keio
University Business School for 4 years. I have also been an active member in
the government telecom deregulation committee. I left Keio University last
year and founded eAccess in November 1999. With less than one year in
operation, eAccess has already established a strong presence in the Japanese
telecom market. We have three phases in our long-term business plan, (1)
broadband access network; (2) CSP and ASP streaming related business; (3) IP
metropolitan backbone infrastructure business. As we are currently looking
for the best global strategic partner to achieve the goal together, we
believe that Enron could become a strong potential partner in Japan.

If you need any more information about eAccess, please do not hesitate to
call or email me.
I am looking forward to seeing you on October 13.

Regards

Dr. Sachio Semmoto

PS : Please advise me email addresses of Messrs. Lay, Skilling and Rice.

Subject: Re: new commercial  

Mr. Sutton-

You are a professed champion for what Enron is about, so I would like to make 
a comment regarding the new commercial for the weather products desks.

I think it is in extremely poor taste to have an effigy of a CEO shot in a 
shooting gallery. I think most decent people would agree with me here.

What are we saying? What are we saying Enron is all about? Are we really a 
dark and Orwellian ship?

There has been a lot of emphasis placed on becoming more sensitive, as a 
society, to the issue of gun violence.

Enron comes off demonic in this commercial, much like Nike comes off as 
satanic in their chainsaw commercial which NBC pulled.

Perhaps this is all a  publicity stunt, where we have CNBC refuse to run the 
ad and then generate an exponential increase in the publicity we receive. 
That would be clever. If not, I would ask you to reconsider the decency of 
the ad, and to ask the Executive Committee how a group of decnet people could 
design such an ad.

Sincerely,

Clayton Vernon

Dear Gil:

Thank you for requesting information regarding my business.  First I am
pleased to be a new member of the US-Mexico Chamber of Commerce and look
forward to meeting you and the members.

I am an independent Real Estate Broker under my own name Paula A. McGowan
and
a CIPS (Certified International Property Specialist) located in Colorado
Springs, Colorado.  I have been active in Colorado Real Estate for the past
seven years and marketing Mexico property and assisting US/International
buyers since 1995.

The main purpose of my business is to assist inbound or outbound individuals
or companies who plan to invest or relocate to another country.  This
includes working with international professionals such as real estate
practitioners, attorneys, accountants, lenders or developers on their
behalf.
 I will assist companies wishing to locate production facilities in
Colorado,
Internationally or in Mexico such as the state of Sonora and will inquire
about government incentives to companies willing to relocate.  I also make
referrals to real estate practitioners and professionals in other countries.

I am a member of FIABCI, (The International Real Estate Federation) based in
France which provides me direct access to international real estate contacts
and professionals in over 55 countries throughout the world.  I am also a
member of The National Association of Realtors International, CIPS Network
which is a resource of hundreds of real estate practitioners who specialize
in international property practices throughout the globe. These
organizations
provide our members an avenue where we can market property for clients at
marketing sessions held during US and International conventions.  In
Colorado
I am a member of the Colorado Association of Realtors, the Pikes Peak
Association of Realtors and a member of the Broadmoor Golf Club.

When my parents moved to Mexico in the late 50's, my love of Mexico began.
I
made many trips to visit them, have close friends of 20 years in the Guaymas
area and know many of the business people.  My husband and I reside in San
Carlos, Sonora, Mexico part time.  We have been active in Mexico Senior Golf
Tournaments in Acapulco, Guadalajara and San Carlos during the past 14
years.
 We are past members of the Asociacion Mexicana A.C. De Golf Senior, the San
Carlos Country Club/Club de Golf de Guaymas and I am a member of Los
Recuerdos, a women's organization in San Carlos.

I presently market property in Guaymas, Sonora, Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca, a
home in Guadalajara and a 320 acre ranch in Valle De Bravo, Mexico.  These
properties can be seen on my website at <A
HREF=""http://www.paulamcgowan.com"">
www.paulamcgowan.com</A>.

Please feel free to contact me if I can be of help to you or the members.

Best Regards,

and its staff.  I always dreamed of working for a company that truly cared.  
My prayers were answered.  I am proud to be a part of this team and look 
forward to many years of prosperity and success.  After working for a private 
practice for 10 years and being told that the corporate work environment was 
impersonal, I have seen ENRON promote and display respect, integrity, 
communication and excellence.  If someone gives respect, the person receiving 
it might build up their self-esteem and in return respect others.  Being 
honest gains trust and sometimes trust can be more valuable than money.  
Without communication, walls are built and eventually tumble down hurting 
everyone/everything surrounding them.  I really applaud your vision on 
communication.  Good communication is the main ingredient in every view of 
life.  Keep up the good work.  Striving for excellence encourages people to 
work hard, utilize their creative minds, explore new areas, and learn to 
adjust to change.

 Hello! I wanted to inform you of an exclusive Delphi Event.  Attached is a

is going to be a truly unique experience.

 I would like to extend you and other senior level executives at Enron an 
invitation to this  event. I have already invited George Short. This event is

early registration fee is $2500.00 per seat.

 I will follow up with you later in the week. In the meantime, if you have 
any questions, please e-mail or call me at 617-247-1511.

was a tremendous success, and everyone should be congratulated that worked
on the planning!
Now to the final items.  We are billing everyone for the hotel, golf and
regatta this week and we have a few questions.  The hotel and golf are easy.
However the regatta is a different situation.  When we started this project,
the cost of the regatta was much less than when we finished.  We quoted
$85.00 per person, however the Millennium rate was actually $100.00 per
person.  This would not be such a great problem, however we had 33 no-shows
for the regatta.  This being said, we have two choices.  We bill those that
sailed for an additional $15.00 to make their charge $100.00 which then
leaves us with a negative $3500.00.  Or, we also bill the 33 no-shows for
$100.00 each which puts us pretty close to break even.
In the big picture, there have been some budget cost that were less than
expected and some that were more.  We will have the final budget complete by
the end of next week.
The most important issue, is it acceptable to bill those that sailed $100.00
or do you want us to stay at the original price of $85.00?......Then, of
course, what should we do about the no shows?  Possibly bill them a
cancellation fee or the full fee?  Or, forget and forgive this time?
I am leaving for Paradise tomorrow, however my trusted partner Janelle will
be here until the 20th of January.  We would like to get everything
finalized before she leaves.
Give us your thoughts.

The EX-MC Director
Sharon

MAYOR VERA KATZ, COMMISSIONER ERIK STEN PRESENT HOLISTIC APPROACH TO
ADDRESSING HOMELESS ISSUES
Reaffirming their commitment to providing safe, affordable housing while
standing firm against homeless camping in the City of Portland, Mayor Vera
Katz and Commissioner Erik Sten held a news conference today to announce
their holistic approach to address homeless and housing issues.   The two
focused on the City's ongoing efforts to preserve and create more affordable
housing, the current tools available to continue enforcing anti-camping
laws, and announced an expanded partnership with JOIN -- a private
organization that does outreach to homeless people.

""While I am still a firm believer in the need for the anti-camping ordinance
to prevent unsafe and unsanitary campgrounds, this has given us the
opportunity to take a closer look at what we in the City are doing to
provide housing and shelter opportunities for everyone,"" said Katz, ""and
while we've made strides meeting our affordable housing commitments, there
is still more we can do.""

Katz and Commissioner Erik Sten announced their intent to follow the
recommendation of Sten's 0-30% Housing Resources Task Force to spend $3.5
million of the $5 million allocated for affordable housing this coming year
on housing for those in the 0-30 percent median income range.  Over the last
seven years, the City of Portland has committed nearly $270 million towards
affordable housing, in addition to foregoing $10.5 million in revenue
through tax abatements.

""Homelessness is an issue that should be addressed by first dealing with the
individual at a personal level,"" said Commissioner Sten.  ""I appreciate that
the City is continuing to move forward on doing this with aggressive efforts
around things such as housing and outreach services.""

Katz and Sten also noted recent successes in meeting affordable housing
needs, including the Portland Development Commission's just-completed
purchase of the Fountain Place apartment building and the recent opening of
Ritzdorf Court which completed the Shelter Reconfiguration Plan.  The
Fountain Place acquisition -- completed just last Friday, means the city
will save the building's affordable housing rates, and serve as potential
replacement housing for nearby low-income units soon to be lost.

Additionally, Katz and Sten also announced an expanded partnership with JOIN
-- an outreach group that works to connect the homeless with services.

The Bureau of Housing and Community Development plans to increase JOIN's
current contract with the bureau to a total of $90,000.  This money,
combined with a new $80,000 contribution from the Portland Police Bureau,
will increase the number of JOIN outreach workers, enabling them to work in
every precinct to link homeless people with housing assistance resources.

""It is critical that we find ways for all of us to work together to help
homeless people find their way off the streets -- that means our outreach
workers, police, ODOT, and neighbors all collaborating to make that happen,""
said Rob Justus, Executive Director, JOIN.  ""Our ultimate goal is to respond
to homelessness and address the negative effect of hundreds on the streets
by helping people into housing.  By engaging the homeless people where they
are -- whether it's under a bridge or in an alleyway -- our outreach workers
can help them begin that transition off the streets.""

At the same time, Katz and Sten said that the City's aggressive efforts to
preserve and create affordable housing opportunities and to link homeless
individuals to those opportunities, made it all the more reasonable to
continue to enforce the City's anti-camping policy which prevents unsafe and
unhealthy campsites from degrading neighborhood livability.  Both said they
are pleased the Multnomah County District Attorney has decided to appeal
Judge Stephen Gallagher's opinion that the City's Homeless Camping Ordinance
is unconstitutional.

While the City Attorney's Office and DA's Office continue to analyze the
implications of the Gallagher opinion, Portland Police Bureau Assistant
Chief Bruce Prunk outlined alternative tools the City intends to use to
continue its efforts to restrict homeless camping in public areas.

1. Parks -- City Code closes most City parks between midnight and 5
a.m., others, such as Forest Park, close earlier.  After closure, people
camping would be subject to state law prohibition on criminal trespass in
the second degree, and police could issue citations and/or remove people for
trespassing.  The City also has the ability to exclude people from City
parks for a period of not more than 30 days.  Permanent or temporary
structures or facilities are also prohibited by City Code at all times, so
police could issue citations or remove people violating the ordinance as an
unclassified misdemeanor.

2. Highway Overpasses -- Oregon Department of Transportation property
under I-5 and I-405 overpasses are posted with ""No Trespassing"" signs, which
means police could issue citations to anyone camping at those locations.

3. Sidewalks -- There are provisions of the City Code that prohibit
sidewalk obstructions.

4. Parking -- City Code prohibits parking a recreational vehicle in the
public right of way directly across from a residential, public park, church
or school property unless the vehicle is being loaded and unloaded for a
period not to exceed eight hours.  In addition, no vehicle may park on the
public right of way or other public property in excess of 24 hours without
City permission.  If so, the vehicle may be removed.

Prunk said the Police Bureau would continue to work with the partners
currently in place, such as JOIN, noting that recent efforts have focused
less on anti-camping citations, and more on trespassing violations.

Joe and I hve had several conversations trying to work out his schedule, but
his classes plus moving his parents from NYC to California at that time make
it impossible for him to come, although he would very, very much like to do
so.
I would suggest that we invite Tom Campbell, the Republican congressman who
just lost his shot at the senate against one of the two women (I forget which
one, left or lefter) and who is again teaching at Stanford Law School. He is
brilliant, and we could give him the topic of ""Enron and Market-Regulatory
Failure: What Are The Constraints on Its Behavior? Where Do the Risks Lie in
the Future?"" Or some such thing.
I will read When Genius Fails in the next few hours and decide about its
author.
What would you think of having Spence Abraham to dinner, and moving Bill
Kristol to the morning if Spence can come?

Ken and I just cut short our Italy trip with friends to return to Houston
for the birth of our 6th grandchild (which is the final one for this round
of four pregnancies).  We were happy to return home and I am a very thankful
and thrilled grandmother (aka Momie, Mamamia, Mamia, Mia).  This was the
first live birth that I have personally witnessed since my last baby, Beau,
and it was VERY exhilarating and VERY emotional, as evidenced by the
attached photos.  I hope you will enjoy seeing my new grandson ""Pate David
Herrold"" (Pate was Courtney's maiden name) who was born on June 8, 2000 at
7:19 p.m.  Pate was 7 lbs, 10 ozs, 20 inches long with a lot of dark curly
hair.  I think he looks exactly like David at birth, but time will tell.
These photos were taken in the delivery room within the first 15-20 minutes
of his birth prior to being cleaned up and returned to the nursery.  He
looks pretty darn good for just having arrived into this world with such
great force.  So far, he is a VERY calm and good infant just like his Daddy
was.  Enjoy!  Big kiss and lots of love, LPL

Remains So Strong."" The series is expected to air on October 2 - 6 on NHK's

series will focus on innovative U.S. companies that are taking the lead in 
various segments of the favorable new economy.  In addition to Enron, they 
intend to cover firms such as Cisco Systems, Palm Inc. and AOL. 

We have arranged for them to interview you from 9:00 until 10:00 a.m. on 
Monday, September 18.  We will have them set up and conduct the interview in 
the board room.  If you agree and time permits, they also would like to 
briefly film you in your office and in a meeting setting, which we could 
stage in the board room.  

In the interview, the reporters will want you to explain how Enron has 
successfully changed from an old economy to a new economy company.  They will 
be interested to know what enabled such dramatic change and how Enron has 
achieved such success in B2B, broadband, energy services and merchant 
activities.  They also would appreciate your thoughts on how these models may 
apply in Japan, as well as your evaluation of the Japanese market and our 
general business strategy for the market.

By tomorrow, we will forward a tentative list of questions from the NHK 
reporters.  In addition, Joe Hirl and his group are preparing briefing 
materials on the Japanese market and Enron Japan, which will be faxed to you

Gas Pipeline Route.  Ultimately, I believe that ARC is looking for certain 
strategic investors to provide founding capital to fund the development of 
this proposal.  To the extent that this is a open access non-discriminatory 
pipe, ENA's opportunity lies in being a shipper to capitalize on basis 
markets or customer transactions that provide attractive risk reward 
characteristics. Other than understanding the potential flows and costs, 
there is probably not much we need to do today given a 2006 start from an ENA 
point of view.

The ARC consortium needs to fund approximately $30M to develop this project.  
The US and Canadian aboriginal groups will receive 33% ownership for $10M.  
the remaining $20M and 67% will be funded by a group of producers, pipelines, 
venture capital and the ""organizing group"" (40%!!).  Stan Horton, if he 
believes this is a commercial possibility, may want to provide a few million 
of founding capital to the venture in order to preserve him the option to 
participate as an equity holder or operator if this becomes a reality.

Ken,
Thank you for the opportunity to meet today at the ""Enron Teaching Excellence 
Awards.""  It was an indeed an honor and a privilege to finally speak to you 
in person.  Ironically, when I returned to the office today I received your 
interoffice mail concerning the below email.  I certainly understand that you 
will not be able to attend many events as I am sure that your schedule is 
quite demanding.  I believe that this group will benefit substantially by 
knowing that you are aware that it exists and want to support it.  Is it 
possible to send a brief email to UH alumni at Enron letting them know as 
such?  If the alumni see that you support our efforts, they will take an 
increased interest in participating and provide us a solid foundation with 
which to work.  Please provide me any feedback you may have.

As we talked about today, we would like to begin having occasional ""brown 
bags"" in an effort to get the alumni better acquainted with the university.  
I believe that we should have one with Dr. Smith to promote the image 
campaign, changes at the university, the tier 1 status, etc.  If you could 
make it that would be great but if not that is OK as well.  I will send you 
the date when I have it.

Chet Gladchuk has agreed to work with us to orchestrate a tailgate party on 
Sept. 16th to welcome Dana Dimel in his first home football game.  We will 
have a tent, food, refreshments, football tickets, etc.  I suspect that it 
will be from approx. 4:00 PM to 10:00 PM.  Please let me know if your 
calendar is free.

I am truly excited to have you as alumni and am grateful for your 
approachability.  Please let me stress that I do not expect you to make all 
or even most of our events.  I would just like to let you know what we are 
doing and if you find that you are free, we would love to have you.

Thank you for your time,
Jeff

Subject: Cougars @ Enron

Mr. Lay,
My name is Jeff McClellan and I am President of the ""Cougars @ Enron"".  We 
are a group of Enron employees that are UH alumni that have banded together 
to form a chartered extension of the Houston Alumni Organization.  We had our 
kickoff event in the 50th floor dining room on March 7th of this year and 
have received substantial interest in our organization.  I wanted to drop you 
a line to tell you not only about us, but also what we are doing.  As of 
today, we have 107 employees that have expressed interest in contributing to 
our group's success. We have several stated objectives:

1. Network Enron Cougars together to build strong working relationships.  
This will benefit the employees as well as the company.
2. Raise and present scholarships to Enron dependents to attend the 
University of Houston.  This will help to ease education costs.
3. Assist the company in its recruiting efforts concerning the university.
4. Assist the university through financial gifts whenever possible.

Currently, here is what we have planned:

4/15/2000 The HAO has given us their hall at ""Frontier Fiesta"".   Frontier 
Fiesta is a festival thrown by the students and alumni that provides good 
family   fun. The HAO is having it catered and everyone is invited.

9/16/2000 We are throwing a tailgate party to celebrate Dana Dimel's first 
home football game against Army.  We are working with Chet Gladchuk to set up 
a   tent, have it catered, listen to a live band, football tickets, etc.  We 
would like to make this event open to all of Enron if possible.  The 
university will   provide Enron special recognition on both the Cougar Vision 
Scoreboard and over the PA in both the first and second half of the contest.

These are the confirmed events so far as we are still in the opening stages.  
We anticipate to have more events planned (golf tournament) which I would 
like the opportunity to share with you.  This group is designed to cater to 
its members, the company, and the university and I believe it is going to be 
one of the most successful out there.  To achieve such a plateau, however, we 
need to be a continuous draw to old and new alumni alike.  To have you as an 
alumni is truly a monumental draw to our employees and the university.  Would 
you consider making several appearances with us at our events?  Your 
participation would greatly increase our exposure and ability to accomplish 
our goals and we would love the chance to honor you as one of our most 
distinguished alumni.  If there are any suggestions that you may have as to 
how to further our group, I would love to hear them.  I understand that you 
are extremely busy and I do not wish to monopolize your time but this alumni 
charter is something that I truly believe in and I hope you will agree that 
it has great potential.  With you support, we can attain a level of success 
that will set us aside from any other group.

Thank you for your time,
Jeff

2. Californians Need More Electricity Deregulation, Not Less
3. Urban Riots and Small Business

-------------------------------------------------------------

PAUL CRAIG ROBERTS ASSAILS THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM

The discovery that a Texas-based crime lab technician fabricated phony=20
evidence used by criminal prosecutors to convict innocent people only adds =
to=20
an already strong case against the American criminal justice system,=20
according to Independent Institute Research Fellow Paul Craig Roberts.

""The criminal justice system has lost the ability to screen out unbalanced=
=20
people who use their offices not to serve justice, but to serve bureaucrati=
c=20
success indicators such as conviction rates, propagandistic causes and tort=
=20
lawyers. If truth be known, some of the worst criminals in the country are=
=20
ensconced in the offices of the criminal justice system.""

""The public was shocked to learn that the highly respected FBI Crime Lab wa=
s=20
manufacturing false evidence to aid prosecutors. The public was shocked aga=
in=20
when it was discovered that the Los Angeles Police Department had framed=20
hundreds of people sent to prison.

""These injustices, committed by people whom society trusts to determine gui=
lt=20
and innocence, are not aberrations. If the premier crime lab and a premier=
=20
police department are corrupt, you can imagine the situation elsewhere. And=
=20
indeed, wherever we look we witness the cruelty of a bureaucratized system=
=20
driven not by justice but by conviction rates.""

CALIFORNIANS NEED MORE ELECTRICITY DEREGULATION, NOT LESS

The huge jump in electricity rates in parts of California last summer cause=
d=20
many to believe that the state's deregulation of the electric power industr=
y=20
was a mistake. In response, the state's ""Independent System Operator"" (ISO)=
,=20
the quasi-government agency that manages electricity transmission, imposed=
=20
short-term price ceilings on wholesale electricity rates; its renewal of th=
e=20
price caps last month, extending indefinitely, appears to be the beginning =
of=20
electricity re-regulation.

However, the ISO's price caps ensure that Californians will face future=20
problems, writes Scott Esposito, public affairs intern at The Independent=
=20
Institute, in a new op-ed.

""The ISO's price caps are a case of a remedy that is far worse than the=20
disease,"" writes Esposito. ""By capping the price that generators may sell=
=20
their electricity at $250 per megawatt hour, the ISO=01,s proposal would ma=
ke=20
California a market that no sane generator would enter. Why sell electricit=
y=20
in California for, at most, $250 per megawatt hour, when you can sell it in=
=20
New York for up to $1300 per megawatt hour?""

Californians would be better served by abolishing the ISO and opening=20
electricity transmission to the free market, thereby encouraging the=20
development of new transmission capacity, Esposito argues.

""Massive rate hikes leading to $400 August electricity bills in San Diego,=
=20
and extensive blackouts in San Francisco, have made utility deregulation lo=
ok=20
like a mistake. However, the real mistake lies not with utility deregulatio=
n=20
per se but with its incomplete execution.""

URBAN RIOTS AND SMALL BUSINESSES

Despite pleas by the Bush and Gore camps that their supporters abide by the=
=20
rule of law (if only they could agree on *which* election rules and court=
=20
rulings are applicable), the election mess may turn decidedly uglier --=20
especially if Florida's presidential vote is sent to the Florida Legislatur=
e,=20
a possibility described in last week's LIGHTHOUSE.

That's why it is imperative that Ralph Nader, Jesse Jackson, sundry agit-pr=
op=20
talk show personalities, and other self-appointed spokespersons for the=20
""disenfranchised,"" voice their commitment to civic order.

The lesson of the urban riots of the 1960s is instructive.

The long, hot summers of 1965 to 1968 saw more than three hundred riots,=20
resulting in two hundred deaths and the destruction of several thousand=20
businesses, according to historian Jonathan J. Bean, writing in the fall=20
issue of THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW. Egged on by ideologues, rioters looted=20
unprotected stores to the chant of ""burn, baby, burn.""

After the rioting stopped, a cottage industry of politicians, academics and=
=20
celebrities explained away the mob violence by dwelling on the rioters'=20
""context."" But the injustices suffered by the mobs' victims were completely=
=20
ignored, and some inner-city neighborhoods never recovered, as evidenced by=
=20
the hackneyed image of politicians visiting blighted inner cities and=20
promising, if elected, to do for it what his opponent cannot.

If political operatives in the current election mess wish to cultivate an=
=20
image of statesmanship before things get too ugly they could, as Bean=20
implores policymakers to in general, ""delegitimize 'political' violence by=
=20
refusing to romanticize the actions of a lawless mob.""

The time for you to make a difference is now!

We have only 10 days until we elect a new president and a new
Congress, and the U.S. Chamber needs your help.  The U.S.
Chamber of Commerce represents you - America's business
community - and now is when we can make a difference.

Helping to elect pro-business candidates is not something we
should take for granted. That's why the U.S. Chamber has been
working hard over the past few months to help pro-business
candidates get elected. We've endorsed these candidates,
campaigned on their behalf, donated to their campaigns, and,
most importantly, lent them the awesome reputation of the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce.

We now need your help to make sure we are successful on
November 7th.  Please take a moment now and visit the
Elections 2000 page on our web site.  This page can be
found by going to http://www.uschamber.com/Elections/.

Once there, click on Pro-Business Candidates and you will find a
list of the candidates we are actively campaigning for and
support along with information about their race.  After you select
a particular candidate, we have also made it possible for you to
contribute directly to selected campaigns by selecting Contribute
On-line Now!

I would also ask that you take a moment to read a recent op-ed by
U.S. Chamber CEO Tom Donohue.  This op-ed titled - Business
As the Target - highlights the attacks the business community is
under from anti-business candidates.  I also feel it underscores the
importance of helping to elect and voting for pro-business
candidates!

To read Mr. Donohue's op-ed, please click here -
http://www.uschamber.com/Elections/_Business+as+the+Target.htm

Or, to help elect pro-business candidates, please:

1. Visit http://www.uschamber.com/Elections/
2. Click on Pro-Business Candidates
3. Select the candidate you would like to support!
4. Make a contribution of $150, $100, $75, or $50 directly to their campaign!

Please feel free to email me if you have any questions or if I can be of
assistance to you.  And, thank you for helping us to elect candidates
who support business!

Sincerely,

Bill Miller
Political Director


P.S.  Please visit http://www.uschamber.com/Elections/, select a
pro-business candidate, and make a contribution directly to their
campaign.  Remember there are only 10 days left until the
election, so they need support from the business community now.

I have been working to put together the business agenda for the Management 
Conference in November.  The theme I am proposing is ""Reinventing Enron ... 
Again!""  I believe the theme is timely as we celebrate our 15 year history 
and address significant changes for the future.  

Attached is a draft of the agenda for your review.  I had an opportunity to 
run it by Jeff last week.  He was happy with the theme and the first day's 
schedule.  He asked that we keep the second day open given the changes that 
will likely develop between now and November.  He felt the second day might 
best be used to establish a new ""manifest"" for the company.   We will, of 
course, remain flexible.  However, I am showing you the agenda as Jeff saw it 
as an example of how the day might run.

Also, on the first day, we'd like to have a spokesperson from Blockbuster 
speak between Tom Peters and Gary Hamil.  Mr. Peters will help set the theme 
by discussing the need for successful companies to reinvent themselves.  Mr. 
Hamil will present tactical strategies for innovation.  Our thought is that a 
Blockbuster spokesperson could discuss their company's experience with 
reinvention -- they are in an interesting situation as the delivery 
mechanisms for their products are evolving.  Would you recommend we invite 
John Antioco, chairman & CEO, or Mark Gilman, president of New Media?  
Several have indicated that Mr. Gilman would be a more provocative speaker 
and better equipped to address the theme of reinvention.

I look forward to your feedback and/or suggestions.

Thanks,

power-grid operator are locked in a turf war over who has the authority to
order new power plant construction next summer to ensure the state has
enough juice on hand when demand soars.
The California Public Utilities Commission says it can bring emergency
power on line at a fraction of the cost that the Independent System
Operator is expected to pay independent power producers for the same
service.
Under it's plan, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric Co., Edison
International's (EIX) Southern California Edison unit and Sempra Energy's
(SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric Co. were ordered to submit documents by the
end of November stating whether they can build and operate ""peaking"" plants
by June 1.
The utilities weren't immediately available to comment.
On the other hand, the ISO - which is on the verge of signing contracts for
440 peaking units with between 20 and 91 megawatts of electricity - says
the commission's meddling could endanger any chance of additional resources
coming on line in time.
""Any further interference on the state level could destroy the plan
altogether,"" said an ISO source close to the issue. ""There is no guarantee
the utilities will be able to pull this off by next summer. And if the
whole project is scrapped, you can expect there will be blackouts.""
Interference by federal regulators has already cost the ISO two
participants and nearly 600 megawatts in its peaking program.
Calpine Corp. (CPN) and Enron (ENE) initially agreed to build peaking
plants for the ISO next summer, but withdrew their offers after the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission proposed capping the clearing price for
California's wholesale electricity market at $150 a megawatt-hour.
The ISO, which operates one of the state's wholesale power markets and
manages most of the high-voltage transmission grid, has already solicited
and received bids from merchant generators for 1,800 megawatts of new
peaking power for next summer.
Burned by the summer's power crisis and facing an 8,000-MW shortfall next
summer, the ISO put out a request for bids in August. The ISO's board voted
Oct. 30 to enter into the contracts, which it estimated would cost about
$250 million a year for three years.
The state's Electricity Oversight Board, which oversees the performance of
the ISO, and the Public Utilities Commission protested the decision on the
grounds that the contracts were too expensive.
The commission is also questioning whether there is even a need for peaking
power next summer and, if there is, whether the ISO should handle the
solicitation.
""The question also arises as to whether the ISO - which is empowered only
to operate the state's transmission system and which does not represent the
state or its consumers - is the appropriate organization to plan, solicit
and pay for the construction of new power plants across the state,"" the
commission wrote in its Nov. 2 order.
Ind the end, the decision is up to state regulators. If utilities can come
up with a cheaper alternative and if the regulators determine that
additional generation is needed by next summer, then they will follow
through with the utilities proposal.",LAY-K

Ken: I have ""heard"" from two sources in this office that Enron will announce 
my successor today. I have not been advised of the selection and am concerned 
that this announcement will not treat my retirement in an appropriate and 
deserving manner.

I have placed calls to Steve Kean since hearing this rumor but have not 
received a response as of now. Admittedl, our phone service because of the 
office construction is not totally functioning.

Frankly, I think this matter has not been handled in a caring way and I have 
been acccused of giving information on the selection to Tom DeLay which is 
untrue. My office mates are all more aware of the candidates and their status 
than I have been.

I regret having to contact you on this matter but feel that despite my total 
cooperation, allegiance and dedication to Enron, I am not being treated with 
the courtesy and sensitivity that this matter deserves.

Subject: RE: for Rosalee - re Mr. Lay's participation at IEA ministerial


Dear Rosalee,

 I would again like to thank Mr Lay for agreeing to take part in both
our IEA ministerial session and in the OECD Forum 2001 - Sustainable
Development and the New Economy.  As discussed, he is to chair the first of
two energy panels at the FORUM; his is titled ""Fuelling Sustainable
Development"".  On his panel will be Mr Kurt Yeager of EPRI (speaking on
hydrocarbon issues), Mr Luis Echavarri, the head of the OECD's Nuclear
Energy Agency (speaking on nuclear power), and Danish Minister of Energy and
Environment, Svend Auken (speaking on renewables and energy efficiency).
The panel is scheduled to take place starting at 3pm at the Cit, des
Sciences et de l'Industrie, in La Villete, in northern Paris.

As I believe I noted in our previous e-mail communications, while the IEA is
responsible for organising our ministerial session and the substantive
issues related to the energy panels on the FORUM, the OECD is doing the
FORUM logistics.  They have therefore asked that I forward to all speakers
the following note (see below). It asks that Mr Lay provide a number of
logistical inputs, including a biography and photo, as well as information
on any remarks he might choose to make. I note that as the chair of the
first energy panel, he may not wish to make a formal presentation -- but
time does permit this if he wishes, and the decision is at his discretion.
I would appreciate being a cc on any material you send to the OECD so we can
keep our files current.

On our own side, the IEA concluded its Governing Board Meeting last Friday,
and finally approved the ministerial session agenda and arrangements.  While
Mr Priddle will be sending out a formal invitation and set of background
documents to Mr Lay this week, I wanted to give you a heads up and find out
if you had any ""last-minute"" questions which I might help answer.

In addition, I note that your last e-mail indicated Mrs Lay will be in Paris
during our session.  Some of our ministerial representatives are also
planning to bring spouses (in particular US Energy Secretary Abraham, who is
coming with his wife) -- do you think Mrs Lay might wish to participate in
any events during this period with any of these others?  If you let us know,
we would be happy to make arrangements.

Also, please let us know if others will be travelling with Mr Lay, and if we
might facilitate their logistics.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best wishes,

Jonathan Pershing

Subject: Cougars@Enron Golf tournament

Good day to all,
Cougars@Enron is hosting our first annual golf tournament on March 26, 2001 
at Falcon Point Golf Club in Katy.  The purpose for the golf tournament is to 
provide scholarships for Enron dependants to attend the University of Houston 
and fund operating expenses.  Mr. Lay has graciously agreed to be our 
honorary chair for this event which will most certainly guarantee success.  I 
would like to ask that Enron participate in this event from a sponsorship 
capacity. Many Enron employees, University of Houston faculty, students and 
alumni will be participating and I believe that this will be a chance to 
promote the Enron name in all of those areas.  Considering that we are 
pushing the area of recruiting with this university, this will be an 
excellent way to enhance said efforts.  We will be marketing the sponsors 
through advertising, tournament recognition and special mention at the post 
tournament reception and dinner.  The levels are as follows:

Amount Level   What is received 
$5,000.00  Title sponsor  Advertising and recognition throughout the entire 
event.  2 teams of four to play the tournament.  Golf shirts, lunch and      
dinner  for sponsor participants.  Invitation to present scholarships at the 
scholarship dinner subsequent to the event.

$2,500.00 Gold sponsor  Advertising and recognition throughout the entire 
event.  1 team of four to play the tournament.  Golf shirts, lunch and 
dinner      for sponsor participants.  

$2,500.00 Silver sponsor  Advertising and recognition throughout the entire 
event.  2 people to play the tournament.  Golf shirts, lunch and dinner      
for sponsor participants.  

$100  Hole sponsor  Advertising at 1 hole of the tournament.

I believe that Enron would benefit from participating in this event.  The 
scholarships benefits Enron employees, there are 650 Enron employees that are 
graduates of the University of Houston who will take great pride in knowing 
that Enron supports their university, the recruiting program will benefit 
because deans, faculty, professional groups, students and alumni will be 
involved which should enhance relations that would beneficial to our efforts 
there.  

Please let me know what we can do.  I continue to believe that Cougars@Enron 
is a group that can benefit the company, the employees and the university and 
this tournament will be the key to its success.

Thanks for your time!!

give formal notice that they will be ceasing service from Portland to Narita
and Nagoya Japan, as well as several other US cities as of April 1, 2001.
They will have 15 flights a day to 5 cities, down from 24 flights a day to
12 cities.  Included in the cut list are flights to San Francisco, Las
Vegas, Los Angeles, and New York.  Following is the statement I am releasing
to the media today about my disappointment about the situation this leaves
us in and my plans to look for alternate carriers.

""I am very disappointed by today's announcement.  This is a big loss for
Portland, and it will have a lasting effect on our economy.

""Perhaps because of the current strong economy, Portlanders have
consistently rated efforts to 'grow as an international city' lowest on
their list of priorities.  Still, as Mayor I worked long and hard with Delta
over the last ten years and fought for their routes to Osaka and Fukuoka,
because I felt strongly that Portland's future was in being an international
city.  Portland will not continue to thrive if we accept doing business only
within the confines of our city limits.  With the high tech economy of today
and the reach of the internet, we must reach across borders.

""That's why I've led efforts to create business strategies --
Internationalizing Greater Portland I & II -- which focused on air and trade
connections because our business partners are no longer just on the other
side of town, or even the other side of the state.  We are competing in
markets around the world, and with Delta's decision we are losing an
important link to our partners and friends in Asia.  We also stand to lose
connections to major cities right here in the U.S.

""While I understand the economics of this decision -- the unexpected
downturn in the Asian economy, the continuing problems with the INS --  I
have learned something from our Asian partners over the years and that is
the importance of investing in relationships.

""Next week we will open the finest classical Chinese garden outside of
China.  Our goal is to create an atmosphere in Portland where people from
other countries feel comfortable doing business with us because we honor
their culture.

""This sets us back nearly 15 years -- 15 years of promoting Portland to
Asian cities from Sapporo to Seoul.  My mission now is to work hard to
ensure it doesn't take us that long to recover.

""I will be working with our partners in the business community, the Port,
our congressional delegation, and the Governor's office to look at
alternative providers for Asian service. We may have opportunities because
of the state of flux in the airlines industry.  I will also be asking for
more local support for our international efforts.  I have met with
representatives from other cities, and have been looking at the Seattle and
Amsterdam models of promoting their cities internationally.

""Further, I will also be pushing Delta to re-examine its New York route.
This is the 12th largest flight out of PDX, carrying 200,000 people
annually.  It's a route critical to our major retailers and financial
institutions.""",LAY-K

Dear Mr. Lay,

You might recall very kindly hosting a dinner at The Travellers Club in
London for the first energy retreat that we did with Reinhold Heus and Ralph
Hodge. We were very sorry to have missed you this year though we very much
understand that campaigning for the elections was an absolute priority.

I was very pleased to hear that you had tentatively agreed to be able to
make the 25th May free for next years retreat. This years theme, after a
great del of research is set to focus on e commerce and the new economy and
will look at the inter relationship between energy, communication and
investment. I therefore thought that it would be particularly appropriate
given the outstanding work that you are doing in this area. I am sure that
you will feel that the participants are of great interest and I hope that it
will be a real learning experience for both the state companies and the
international energy companies.

BOULDER,  Colorado  -  September  28,  2000: Ribozyme Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
(RPI)  (NASDAQ:RZYM)  today announced that it has repurchased its rights to
Heptazyme?  from  Eli Lilly and Company and will initiate Phase II clinical
trials  as  soon  as  possible  for  the Anti-Hepatitis C ribozyme to study
dose-ranging  and  biological  markers  of  the  drug's efficacy in chronic
Hepatitis C patients.

Earlier  this month, RPI and Eli Lilly and Company completed a 28 day study
of Heptazyme (LY466700) following daily subcutaneous injections that showed
successful  safety,  tolerability  and pharmacokinetics.  The next phase of
clinical trials will examine the safety and efficacy of Heptazyme alone, at
higher  doses  than  used  in  previous  studies,  and  in combination with
interferon,  a  current  treatment  for  patients  with  Hepatitis C  virus
infection.

Lilly has directed the clinical trials for the Anti-Hepatitis C ribozyme to
date   under   a   licensing   agreement  between  the  parties.   Ribozyme
Pharmaceuticals,  Inc.  has now renegotiated the global rights to Heptazyme
and  will  direct  all  subsequent  clinical trials.  The Phase II trial is
expected to begin in the first quarter of 2001.

""We  are  pleased  to  be  able  to repurchase Heptazyme rights and to have
resources  to  develop  it aggressively,"" said Ralph E. Christoffersen, CEO
and  President  of RPI.  ""We are committed to address the need for improved
therapies  for  HCV,  and  plan  to  move forward as quickly as feasible in
Heptazyme's development.""

Ribozymes   are  the  product  of  Nobel  Prize  winning  science  and  are
synthetically engineered to act as ""molecular scissors"" capable of cleaving
target RNA in a highly specific manner.

RPI (www.rpi.com), located in Boulder, Colorado, is the acknowledged leader
in ribozyme therapeutic development.  RPI has recently announced a ribozyme
commercial  development  program  to develop a ribozyme therapeutic against
Hepatitis  B.  RPI is partnered with Chiron Corporation for the development
and  commercialization  of ANGIOZYME?, an anti-angiogenic ribozyme designed
to  inhibit  the  growth  of new blood supplies to tumors and prevent tumor
growth  and  metastasis.   ANGIOZYME  is  in  Phase I/II clinical trials in
cancer  patients  at  the  Cleveland Clinic.  RPI is also partnered with an
affiliate  of Elan Corporation plc for development and commercialization of
HERZYME?, an anti-HER-2 ribozyme for treatment of breast and other cancers,
through RPI's subsidiary Medizyme Pharmaceuticals Ltd.

RPI  will  have  a Live Webcast regarding this information today at 3:00 pm
MDT.  This webcast can be accessed through the RPI website (www.rpi.com) in
the Investor Relations section.

This morning Rich Gardner of SSB issued a negative report on the segment and
specifically called out us. He sited high channel inventory parts shortages
and general demand. Report also called out Dell. We issued statement around
midday.

This is the same analyst that called out stuffing last quarter.

To say we are annoyed would be a gross understatement and we are being as
aggressive as we can be within limits of disclosure

I will make some personal visits this week

It is a real nervous market

involvement in Colombia and U.S.-South African relations.

For further information, contact the CSIS Director of Studies Office at 
202-887-0200, or reply to this e-mail.

*************************
U.S. Involvement in Colombia.

Edward Luttwak, CSIS senior fellow, says that the Colombian guerrilla groups, 
the FARC and ELN, aren't trained, aren't disciplined, and don't know how to 
shoot. How then do they control vast amounts of territory in southern 
Colombia? Because the Colombian army was never properly trained, asserts 
Luttwak. And the U.S. military is now teaching the Colombian army tactics 
that aren't appropriate for a jungle environment. Luttwak believes that the 
$1.3 billion aid package signed by Clinton to help the Colombian army is a 
mistake. Plus, whatever the United States does this year in terms of aid, it 
will have to do again next year.

Why is the United States getting involved?  The popular reason repeated on 
the Hill is to destroy the Colombian narcotics trade. Colombia contains most 
of the narcotics activity now, but that can easily move to a different 
country. The worst thing the United States could do, says Luttwak, would be 
to push the bulk of the coca production to a different Andean country in the 
""arc of fragility."" U.S. involvement also helps to mitigate the chances of 
the guerrillas overthrowing the civilian government, says Luttwak, noting 
that President Andres Pastrana's popularity is extremely low.

What then should the United States do? Luttwak's answer is to organize mobile 
training teams of people (as the United States did in El Salvador) to go into 
villages to create home guards, which would use weapons of a different 
caliber than the army. Luttwak asserts that this would work because people 
aren't divided politically at the village level. Such a solution, however, 
will not diminish narcotics trafficking.


The United States and South Africa: Drifting Apart?
The U.S.-South African relationship has undergone a significant shift, 
asserts Stephen Morrison, director of the CSIS Africa Program. The result of 
this shift is that the United States now feels that it needs South Africa 
much less than it did six years ago, while South Africa has come to value its 
relations with the United States much more than ever before.

For both countries, however, there has been a ratcheting down of 
expectations.  South African president Thabo Mbeki's May visit to Washington 
was marked by an anxiety that the next administration may reduce its contact 
with Africa. Thus, Mbeki attempted to reach out to a number of audiences-both 
the Bush and Gore camps as well as the U.S. Congress, corporate sector, and 
media. The response of the latter three was rather muted.

While the Gore-Mbeki Binational Commission proved that high-level 
intervention is essential to move forward on key issues, lacking was serious 
cooperation at the diplomatic level to respond to crises such as those in 
Congo, Angola, Zimbabwe, Sudan, Nigeria, or Sierra Leone. Plus, South Africa, 
fueled by protectionist interests, was largely ambivalent to the Africa 
Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). It remains to be seen if the South African 
private sector will seize this opportunity.

Morrison says that in the future, the relationship will be evaluated 
according to the level of development of joint diplomatic initiatives in 
Zimbabwe and Congo, collaboration on the AIDS epidemic, security enhancement, 
trade and investment, and debt relief. Some form of the binational commission 
should remain in place for the next administration, warns Morrison, because 
otherwise there will be contentious wrangling over issues of trade and 
investment, international property rights, AIDS policy, and security.

dealing with Margaret Barradas who is Howard's superior.  Where James Shelton 
was a hard act to follow, Howard should be a piece of cake.  Anyone merely

I just wanted to follow up to make sure that all the arrangements for Mr
Lay's trip to Paris are in order.  In particular, I wanted to make sure that
the materials for the FORUM, including the VIP pass for his car and driver
made it to you.  Please let me know if not, and I will arrange to have the
materials left at his hotel pending his arrival.

I have been in touch with Mr Bradley on input to Mr Lay's remarks, and all
seems in order on that front.

Thanks again for your help.

2. Key Barriers to Distributed Generation

Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Stand-by Charges

Solution: The executive orders issued by the Governor on February 14th took=
 a=20
step in the right direction.  Utility stand-by charges have always been=20
designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position, extract=20
monopoly prices from customers, or both.  But there is no reason to limit t=
he=20
elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than=20
1MW.  These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for=
=20
California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc=
e=20
the risk of black outs this summer.  We would propose lifting the cap by=20
offering amendments to SB27X, which is designed to facilitate development o=
f=20
distributed generation.
=20
Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with=20
investor-owned and municipal utilities

Solution:   The Governor=01,s executive order regarding interconnection is =
a=20
step in the right direction=01*D-D-26-01 requires utilities to complete=20
interconnection studies within 7 days.  California should ensure that this=
=20
requirement applies to all generation facilities, including distributed=20
generation.  In addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when=
=20
interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome=
=20
through executive orders or other regulations.  To the greatest extent=20
possible, California should shift control over interconnection away from th=
e=20
utility and place that control with the California ISO.  This could be=20
accomplished through amendments to SB 27X.

Permitting and Air Quality Issues
Developers of distributed (i.e., =01&on-site=018) generation that is 50 MWs=
 or=20
greater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an=
d=20
therefore face all of the impediments to development that large-scale=20
generation faces. =20

Solution: California should ensure that the executive orders (D-22-01 thru=
=20
D-26-01) issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant=
=20
output apply equally to smaller scale, =01&distributed generation=018 facil=
ities.=20
In addition, distributed generation that is less than 50 MWs continues to=
=20
face local opposition.  The State should ensure that local, parochial=20
interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects=
. =20
These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SB27X.

3. Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase=
=20
Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities=20

Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with=
=20
suppliers.
Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th=
e=20
goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible.
However, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk=
=20
concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms.
We understand that the lion=01,s share of counterparties share Enron=01,s c=
redit=20
risk concerns.
Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and=
=20
is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to=
=20
both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements=
=20
going forward.

Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue

Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority
The language in AB1X is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to=20
charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power.  From our=
=20
analysis of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the=20
California PUC=01,s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California.  =
As=20
such, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat=
es=20
adequate charges to cover DWR=01,s costs of power purchases.

Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract =01&Prudence=018
The language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public=
=20
Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are=
=20
=01&imprudent.=018  On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then ref=
use to=20
allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power=20
purchases.  Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr=
ee=20
to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that=
=20
DWR has entered into with suppliers.
=20
Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to=
=20
Recover DWR=01,s Costs of Power Purchases
In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority=
=20
noted above, the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to=
=20
the specific ratemaking =01&mechanics=018 that AB1X directs the PUC to empl=
oy to=20
permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs. Based on our analysis, it i=
s=20
extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu=
re=20
DWR recovers its power purchase costs.  Moreover, as currently drafted, it =
is=20
difficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in=
=20
rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR=01,s power purchase=
=20
costs.  Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since=
=20
suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover=
=20
from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power.

Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk=20

We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri=
sk=20
issues.  We have identified three options:

Amend AB1X
The amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the=
=20
PUC would accept as =01&prudent and reasonable=018 all purchase costs incur=
red by=20
DWR, and b) the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary =
to=20
ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases.  This is the=
=20
preferred option, though we understand that the there may be some political=
=20
challenges standing in the way of amending AB1X.  (See attached file=20
entitled, =01&AmendAB1X.doc=018.)

Clarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and=20
through Contract Language
This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to=20
implement.  However, it is more complicated and could take significantly mo=
re=20
time to implement than the ""legislative"" fix.  We have attached electronic=
=20
copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC=
=20
would need to issue under this option.  (See attached file entitled,=20
=01&cpuctalkingpoints.doc.=018)

Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk
As indicated in our letter responding to DWR=01,s RFP, we are willing to ac=
cept=20
other forms of credit from DWR.  Those options include a letter of credit,=
=20
cash prepayment, or an acceptable form of collateral.  DWR officials have=
=20
indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options. That is, DWR=
=20
prefers to clarify the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through=
=20
contract amendments.

4. California=01,s Supply-demand Picture Heading into Summer 2001

Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research=20
Associates (CERA), a private sector energy think tank, have issued reports=
=20
showing that California faces a severe supply-demand imbalance.  They diffe=
r=20
only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available.  Al=
l=20
credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer=
=20
of 2001 and that unless a solution is found immediately, blackouts are=20
likely. =20

CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this=20
summer by approximately 5,000 MW.   These numbers are in line with our=20
estimates.  California=01,s supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin,=
 well=20
below the average 15-20%, which is recommended for reliable system operatio=
n=20
in the West.  Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power=
=20
than other regions, reserves are particularly important, owing to the=20
unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t=
o=20
date. In the event of a low rain and snow period, the system must possess t=
he=20
flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply. =20
California=01,s very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to =
this=20
requirement. =20

Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 2001 include the early=
=20
draw-down of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage California's seve=
re=20
supply-demand gap; emissions restrictions on existing plants; and a reduced=
=20
number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the=20
utilities.  Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren=
t=20
pace of siting, permitting and construction, adequate supplies will not be=
=20
added to correct the market imbalance until 2003 at the earliest.

CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately 20 hours of=
=20
rolling black outs this summer.  The CEC paints a considerably more=20
optimistic scenario, betting that California will bring an additional 5,000=
=20
MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand.  It is our view that California=
=20
should view the CEC's ""rosy scenario"" with considerable skepticism.

5. Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California=
=01,s=20
Electricity Crisis

This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution.  We wil=
l=20
deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing=
=20
bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals.

As we have suggested throughout the crisis, any solution to California's=20
crisis must focus on four issues:

Increase supply
Decrease demand
Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market
Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency

Increase supply--Legislative vehicle: SB28X (Sher)
To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years. =
=20
Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less=
=20
than a year.  In California, it takes about six years, or longer.

The Governor=01,s executive orders and Senator Sher=01,s siting reform legi=
slation=20
are steps in the right direction.  Our suggested amendments can improve tho=
se=20
efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face=
=20
in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit=20
requirements included in the CEC's certification requirements.  Enron=01,s=
=20
proposal seeks to streamline the process for 1) obtaining credits and 2)=20
transfering credits between air districts.  In addition, it creates an=20
innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund=20
emissions in advance of obtaining certification, and permits the affected a=
ir=20
districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the=20
required reductions in pollution emissions.

Decrease demand=01*Legislative Vehicle:   AB31X (Wright)
Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California, closing=
=20
the supply-demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the=
=20
best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer.  This can be accomplished mo=
st=20
effectively and quickly in two ways:

Buy-down demand
California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun=
d=20
to finance DWR=01,s power purchases.  California could likely reduce demand=
 more=20
economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou=
ld=20
be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period (e.g.,=
=20
through the summer months).  DWR could easily run an on-line auction to=20
determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions.  To=20
participate, businesses would be required to have the metering equipment=20
necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the=20
reductions.  Enron has developed an on-line auction software package, =01&D=
eal=20
Bench,=018 that it would be willing to contribute to the effort.

Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment
To be successful, customers need access to the following key elements:

An internet based hour-ahead price posting system to track the market price=
=20
for hour-ahead power in real time.=20
Real-time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment=
=20
verification.
Settlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be=
=20
paid for load reduction (=01&Negawatts=018).

The potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ=
e:

=01&creation=018 of additional summer peaking capacity in California, parti=
cularly=20
in the short term, without requiring construction of additional generation=
=20
resources.
reduction of  peak or super-peak load on the over-stressed California=20
electric system, thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity =
in=20
the state.
fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris=
k=20
of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to=20
customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for=
=20
responding.=20

We estimate that we could generate a summer 2001 on-peak demand response in=
=20
excess of 400 MW during certain high cost hours, and a demand response for=
=20
summer 2002 on-peak hours that could exceed 1000 MW.  We further estimate=
=20
that the market response to this program from all ESPs could be 2 to 3 time=
s=20
that amount.  We recommend that the State of California provide rebates=20
directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and=20
control systems that would support load curtailment implementation.

Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market=01*Legislative vehi=
cle:=20
SB27X
The only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we=
re=20
customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy=
=20
service providers.  Ironically, AB1X takes that important option away from=
=20
customers and businesses.  It is critical that AB1X be amended to remove th=
e=20
prohibition against Direct Access.

Enron's legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a=
=20
direct access transaction, while simultaneously addressing the Department o=
f=20
Water Resources' concerns about stranded power costs that might result from=
=20
customer migration. =20

In addition, California will only achieve a competitive retail market when=
=20
the utility is removed completely from the procurement function.  Procureme=
nt=20
is not a utility core competency, as evidenced by the dire financial=20
condition in which the utilities now find themselves.  California should=20
therefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement=20
function entirely, with the goal of having all customers served by a=20
non-utility provider within 36 months.  To execute the transition, Californ=
ia=20
should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the 36-month period =
in=20
which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments=
=20
of utility load.

Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency=01*Legislative =
vehicle:=20
AB18X
Utility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand=
. =20
In short, bankruptcy does nothing to solve California=01,s supply-demand=20
imbalance.  In addition, bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers=
=20
and businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having Californ=
ia=20
State government assume the role of =01&electricity buyer=018 for an extend=
ed=20
period of time.  Finally, bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidenc=
e=20
in California's energy markets and the private sector's willingness to=20
participate in that market.

California can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a=
=20
series of staged rate increases.  California should design those rate=20
increases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without=

In addition, the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways:=

We are down to the wire and the race couldn't be
closer. Every vote counts, even those of you in Texas.
Please, remember to vote and go early, polls open at
7am across the country and close at 7pm but don't put
it off until 7pm as there could be lines and the
supervisors are not required to keep the polls open
after 7pm for those in line.
Remind your friends and family to vote and if someone
needs transportation to the polls, give them a ride or
call your local Victory 2000 office (Republicans) or
your local Democratic campaign office, they will have
people available to transport people to the polls.
Keep an eye out while you are at the polls for
electoral fraud and report any suspicious activity
including inappropriate campaigning to the poll
watchers at the polls. The Democrats and the
Republicans will have representatives at most of the
polls, let them know if there is suspicious activity.
Finally, if you have time, call your local offices and
offer your time to make phone calls to encourage
people to get out and vote, pass out leaflets, or to
be available to help prevent of voter fraud.

Finally, enjoy the evening and watch the results come
in. There are election watch parties everywhere!!!

Just one more day (and no more mass political e-mail's
from me and everyone else)!
Take care and VOTE!
Liz

Richard Lewis mentioned to me that you had recently read an article about 
Regenesys, the large-scale battery technology being developed in the UK, and 
wanted to know more about Enron's potential interest in this technology.  I 
am a Manager in our UK Origination and have tracked the progress of Regenesys 
since it first came on the scene over one year ago.  We have watched it with 
interest given the historical peak/off-peak spread in this country's power 
market.  Bruce Stram and I have also co-ordinated our efforts on the 
preliminary analysis.

Below is a brief summary of Regenesys, our initial views on the technology 
and our response going forward.

Technology Summary
large-scale battery system using two oppositely-charged electrolytes that are 
separated by an ion exchange membrane
current generating plant capacity up to 14.75 MW per unit (or 120 MWh per day)
response time within 20 milliseconds
it can release full power within a few seconds thereby yielding brief 
capacity of up to 500 MW
$1500 / kW capital costs initially which are expected to decrease to approx. 
$750 / kW 
18 month build time for facility which requires a site of just under 1 
hectare (50 m x 60 m)


Latest Developments
Innogy announced last month that it will proceed with it's first Regenesys 
plant at Aberthaw Power Station in the UK
Tennessee Valley Authority has just signed some form of agreement with Innogy 
on the Regenesys technology but there are no firm decisions to build a unit 
there yet

Our Cynical Point of View
Innogy have got to go a long way before they can make this technology 
commercially successful
Our initial analysis shows that based on the peak/off-peak spreads they need 
to achieve capital costs less than $600 / kW to be successful - we have not 
seen evidence that this can be achieved
Innogy have been hyping up the technology in the past month to support the 
forthcoming spilt of National Power and to prepare for a potential floatation
There has been a flurry of press releases and news articles recently yet the 
specifications of the technology (including capital cost) have not improved 
since we first looked at this in July 1999
Innogy touts this as a revolution in energy storage for peak/off-peak 
arbitrage, however, commercially it does not compare to having large-scale 
diesel standby generation

On the Brighter Side
The real potential for this technology could be in supporting grid systems 
It has good black start and frequency response capabilities

Way Forward
We are evaluating the commercial attraction of the black start and frequency 
response characteristics with respect to our interests in the UK
I will continue to liaise with Bruce Stram in evaluating any further 
potential in the US

Please let me know if you would like any further details on the above.

Chris",LAY-K

their April issue.  The annual technology/business issue is the magazine's

and a business overview, with an emphasis on our broadband business.  The 
writer, Carol Rust, is scheduled to interview you in your office on Thursday, 
Nov. 30 from 10 a.m. to noon.

She has submitted the following questions in advance of the interview:

How did you achieve the transformation from a gas pipeline company to a 
cutting-edge energy powerhouse?  
How has EnronOnline been developed and what have the benefits been?
What aspects of the company (flexibility, for example) allow it to achieve 
success in so many varied areas?
How do you come up with new ideas?
Of all the things for an energy company to do, why offer bandwidth to content 
providers?
What are the exact mechanics of the broadband operation?
How much of the market does Enron have now, and how much does Enron want?
What did start-up of the broadband business involve?
What were the costs -- money and time?
What do you say to nay-sayers who say Enron will remain only a bit player in 
this field?
What's next?

I will bring Carol to your office at 10 a.m. and sit in on the interview to 
coordinate any follow-up questions.

Dear Mr. Lay:
             My name is James Partsch-Galvan. I am the Libertarian Candidate
for Texas Rep. 147. I do not support this new Sports Arena Deal. I was on the
winning side last year, and I am galvanizing to be be on the winning side
this year.
I find it very deporable that the Sports Authority cancelled its Board
Meeting tomorrow. This is another dirty trick that the Sports Authority is
making to make it harder for citizens to voice their opinions. This is one
more reason for taxpayers to vote no for any taxpayer funds to fund a new
arena that is not needed.
Sincerely, James Partsch-Galvan
Libertarian Candidate for Texas Rep. 147

******E-NEWS THIS WEEK*******

KVAERNER WINS BALAL AWARD
Tehran - Kvaerner Singapore, part of the Anglo-Norwegian group, has been
appointed detailed engineering contractor for the offshore production
platform in the Balal oil field, being developed by TotalFinaElf. The award
follows Iranian Offshore Engineering and Construction (OIEC) and Singapore's
SembCorp winning the $60m contract for installation of the platform to
process 40,000bbl/d of oil and 14mcfd of associated gas.
The Anglo-Norwegian group was brought in by NIOC subsidiary Petro Pars in
April to manage the first phase development of South Pars gas field. In a
separate development, OIEC and Petro Iran are reported to be looking for a
foreign partner to take a 30% stake in the $850m Salman offshore project,
which the two Iranian companies won in October on a buy-back basis. The
Salman contract, tendered in 1998, requires the rebuilding of war-damaged
facilities and upgrading production at the field by 45,000 bbl/d to 130,000
bbl/d as well as developing an associated gas structure. http://www.irna.com


OPEC TO SUSPEND 20-DAY MECHANISM UNTIL JANUARY
Vienna - OPEC exporters have rejected calls from consuming nations for
further extra crude supplies that would have helped ease stubbornly high
world oil prices and cut fuel bills this winter. It appears, as the
Ministers meet in Austria this month, that OPEC will not be adding further
increases to world supplies despite oil prices remaining outside its
automatic 20-day production increase mechanism, set at $22-28/bbl. 'There
will be no increases this year under any circumstances,' Indonesian Oil
Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro told awaiting reporters after a two-hour
meeting ahead of the formal ratification of the decision.
http://www.opec.org/


SUDAN SIGN EXPLORATION AGREEMENT
Khartoum - Sudan has signed an oil exploration agreement with several local
and international companies for an area in central Sudan, the
government-owned Al-Anbaa newspaper reported on Sunday. 'Sudan has signed a
production agreement...covering prospecting, development and transportation
of oil with Gulf oil companies, the Chinese National Petroleum Corp, Al Than
and Sudapet,' the daily said.
Al-Anbaa said the agreement covered a 75sq.km area on the western bank of
the White Nile, south of the town of Rabak, about 275km south of Khartoum.
The Gulf companies hold a 46% stake in the investment, the Chinese company
has 23%, Al Than also has 23% and Sudapet holds 8%.
Sudan, which produces about 185,000 barrels per day of crude oil, began
crude exports in August 1999. It had previously been importing oil and oil
products for about $300m a year, eating up most of its export earnings. It
has also been reported this week that Talisman Energy are to step up their
exploration efforts in the country, despite opposition from humanitarian
groups.


SHELL INK EGYPTIAN GTL AGREEMENT
Cairo - Royal Dutch/Shell Group confirmed this week that they are to invest
$1.7bn in an Egyptian gas-to-liquids (GTL) plant that could lead the country
to use domestic gas reserves to satisfy its entire oil products market for
more than 50 years.
Egypt is currently an importer of oil products. The oil giant agreed to
initial terms on the deal early in October. Shell said it has now signed a
development protocol with Egyptian General Petroleum for a
75,000-barrel-per-day GTL conversion plant to convert natural gas into
synthetic fuels. Crucially the project is now said to have the backing of
Egyptian Petroleum Minister Sameh Fahmy. Production could be in place by
late 2005, while a plant at the same site producing liquefied natural gas
(LNG) could be up and running earlier, by mid-2004.

Clients and friends:

    Nonprofit organizations that maintain websites will want to know that the
IRS is considering regulating nonprofit Web speech.  Public comments are
being sought by the IRS on these proposed new rules for nonprofits.


    The Internal Revenue Service has released ""Announcement 2000-84""
soliciting public comment on possible new regulations for charities, think
tanks and educational organizations.


    Among the questions the IRS is addressing in its review of exempt

organization's speech on their Internet sites is:


""Does providing a hyperlink on a charitable organization's website to

another organization that engages in political campaign intervention result

in per se prohibited political intervention?""


""To what extent are statements made by subscribers to a forum, such as a

listserv or newsgroup, attributable to an exempt organization that

maintains the forum?""


""Does a website constitute a single publication or communication? If not,

how should it be separated into distinct publications or communications?""


House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, has issued a statement

condemning the IRS' consideration of new regulations for the Internet.


""The IRS has no business getting involved in whether a think thank has

links on its website, or how often a charity's site is updated,"" he said.

""The idea of turning the tax man into a Net cop would have a chilling

effect on free speech on the Internet. I'm glad the agency has not taken

any regulatory action yet. But let's be clear about this. We will be

watching what they do, and we will not tolerate any backdoor attempt to

regulate the Internet.""


The public comment period on this issue will close Feb. 13, 2001, according

to the IRS announcement. Comments are to be directed to Judith E. Kindell,

the principal author of the announcement, at the IRS, 1111 Constitution

Avenue NW, Washington, D.C. 20224.

We hope you find this information of interest.  As always, if we can answer
any questions, please contact us.

Subject: Re: Lawsuit


Gentlemen;

You may or may not be aware, but each of you has been named as a defendant
in a lawsuit.  The lawsuit has been filed by a Plaintiff who is represented
by one of the law firms which has filed suit against i2 in the class action
lawsuit (i.e. the Nike situation).  The Plaintiff in this lawsuit is a
nominal shareholder and acts as a front for the Plaintiff law firm.

What makes the lawsuit different from the class action is that it is a
shareholder derivative lawsuit.  What this means is that the plaintiff
shareholder has filed the lawsuit against each of you to collect damages on
behalf of i2.  The claim is based on the Nike facts, but the Plaintiff is
claiming i2 has been damaged by your actions.   What is interesting is that
all damages recovered would go to i2.  So why the lawsuit?  The Plaintiff
can recover for all legal fees he incurs in bringing the lawsuit.
Derivative actions commonly follow class action filings, as a sort of
""tag-along"" type of action.

The Plaintiff attorney has requested that i2 accept service of the lawsuit
on your behalf.  Normally, I would say no and let the Plaintiff law firm
try and track you down, but they may try and serve you at an inappropriate
time, i.e. client meeting, during a speech.  Please let me know if you
would like for us to accept service on your behalf.  This is very common
practice.

I will send each of you a copy of the lawsuit.  Needless to say, you are
indemnified for this, i2 will pay for all legal fees incurred to defend you
and i2 does have insurance to cover this matter.

Please let me know of your decision to have i2 accept service on your
behalf.

Thanks


Bob Donohoo

Subject: Alzheimer's Research Update

On September 19th Dr. Bill Thies, vice president of medical and scientific 
affairs for the national Alzheimer's Association, will be in Houston to  
provide an update on some of the new and successful research underway for 
Alzheimer's disease.  He'll also be meeting with local reseachers to learn 
what they're doing in order to support and potentially fund their work.  
Since all of you have been such great supporters of our efforts to raise 
funds for this very cause, Phil and I are hosting a breakfast so you can hear 
firsthand how your money is being spent.  No pledge cards will be handed out 
at the door--just juice, coffee and maybe a bagel.  Please join us to hear an 
update from Dr. Thies on September  19 from 7:00 to 8:00 a.m. in the Enron 
Building, Room 49C1.  Please RSVP to Adriana Wynn at X55176.

right on Texas, and left on San Jacinto.  Turn right onto Wood Street which 
will dead-end and you will have to take a left onto Walnut.  The building 
will be on your left and the entrance is located in the middle of the 
building.  There is visitor parking in the front.

The phone number of the studio is 713/223-0951.

If things change on your schedule and you cannot make the video shoot, please

 Linda has interviewed with Ken Lay, Tom White, Mike McConnell and Jeff 
Shankman, who join me in this recommendation.

 Attached are biographical information on Linda and a National Journal 
article identifying Linda among the ""Washington 100"".

 We have conducted extensive reference checks on Linda.  Included among those 
was Secretary Summers who said:

""Nobody I know has the determination she has to get objectives met.""
""Far more capacity to grasp the details than anyone I've seen.""

 On Monday, I will seek Executive Committee approval to extend the offer to 
Linda.

 1. Enron over the past decade has become the most vigorous change agent
 in its industry.  From a leadership perspective, how have you created a
 culture of change in an industry not known for change?

 2. Nortel Networks has clearly made an outstanding transformation into
 the New Economy, similar to Enron's evolution. In Nortel's case, John Roth
 bought Bay Networks and infused the Nortel culture with Bays - almost a
 reverse cultural transformation.  How did you create a New Economy culture
 where innovation, risk-taking and new ideas are embraced and rewarded?

 3. Are there some best practices you can share with other CEOs and
 Managing Directors regarding leading a change?

 4. At best, change is difficult. But being able to change before you
 have to has only been accomplished successfully by a few companies.  How
 did you lead a change effort when you were arguably still a very
 successful utility?

 5. Peter Drucker has said than in stable time you need good management
 but in disruptive times you need leadership.  How have you been able to
 attract and retain what Fortune magazine has called the best management
 team?

 6. The New Economy is really all about creating a culture of
 innovation, where employees see opportunity and not barriers. Enron has
 been masterful at this from gas, to electricity, pulp & paper, and now
 bandwidth. As the ""keeper of the culture"" how did you establish and
 maintain such a culture?

 7. As Enron moves away from Plant, Property and Equipment towards
 Intangible Assets, what has changed for you as a leader in the age of
 intangibles?

 8. Can you list the four or five ""must have"" competencies for the 21st
 Century CEO? What experiences are necessary?

 9. Lets talk about going global. You have made very impressive in-roads
 in India where no other utility has been able to. How did you lead this
 effort? Are there any best practices you can share with your fellow CEO's
 who are thinking about India?

 10. Lets now move to Europe. Enron is the largest gas and power trader
 in Europe. Can you discuss your move into Europe? Again are there some
 best practices for CEOs in the USA moving into Europe?",LAY-K

I was very disappointed to learn today that the Enron Body Shop will be
raising its rates to $25 per month.  While this may be in line with some
benchmarking study, one would hope that Enron would seek to outperform its
peers, given its goal to be rated #1 as best place to work.  Our cross-town
competitor Williams, where I worked for almost 12 years, has a facility that
is at least as good as Enron's, and there is no charge whatsoever.  Why
charge for the use of a facility that promotes Wellness?

I hope you reconsider this increase, but at a minimum provide a lower rate
for the occasional user such as myself.  Given my busy schedule I am lucky
to get there a few times per month, and would happily pay the greater of $5
per visit or the $25/month fee.  A $25/month fee will simply discourage
occasional users.

Please terminate my membership, effective September 1.   I hope that I am
not alone in voicing my unhappiness with this increase.

THE FOX WATCH!

   1. This IMI presents an overview of what are
expected to be the environmental priorities for Mexico's new administration.
The new administration in Mexico has mentioned the following as priority
areas for development over the next six years.

-Review the present environmental standards (NOM's). Make changes to
increase the compliance of micro, small and mid-sized companies.

-Study ways the private sector can participate in the development of
infrastructure to treat and dispose of industrial waste. Implement programs
to facilitate this.

-Launch special programs for large private consumers of potable water to
encourage the use of recycled water.

-Increase federal expenditures on environmental infrastructure along the
Mexico -U.S. border.


2. Implications for U.S. companies: U.S. manufacturers of equipment and
providers of environmental services should be able to increase their market
share during the next six years because of the priorities mentioned above.

3. Companies interested in selling equipment and services should contact:

If you are inclined to accept this invitation, we could put together an 
interesting talk on the importance of good mental health to business with 
some national statistics and then segue into Enron's emphasis on wellness and 
having fun in the workplace.  Our strategy and experience will be very 
interesting to the group since it shows what a corporate leader is doing to 
become the employer of choice in the marketplace.

You could expect a full house (around 400) for the talk.  If it fits into 
your schedule, Jack Bowen said he would be delighted to be honorary chairman 
of the event.

Nice to see you again this morning in the lobby.  It's always a pleasure to 
enjoy your courtesy.  

Three years ago, you helped me get into Enron.  I am still immensely 
grateful.  It has been a fabulous experience.  Now, Azurix is releasing me;  
my last day is 31 DEC 2000.  I'm looking for a new position at Enron.  
Barring that, I take a standard severance package on 01 JAN 2001 and go 
overboard.  I'm taking the typical aggressive Enron approach to networking, 
so if you are aware of something, I'd appreciate knowing.  I'll be over to 
see Stan Horton this afternoon at 16:00.  

I've continued to hone my skills, and provide leadership and creativity in 
difficult circumstances.  
I know Enron is changing.  I'm willing to change (and learn!) with it.  
There's a lot I can do for Enron.  I'd just like to have a shot at it.  

Hope the holidays are joyous and safe for you and Linda and your entire 
family.

Charles Bridge and home or coaches will be provided.  For late nighters the
jazz scene continues in the lobby bar of  the Marriott.

past-present-future.  In the PM Offsites. For dinner and the evening we take
over U Fleku - one of Prague's most famous beer halls dating from the 1700s.

we will invite many local guests. Afterward, the jazz scene continues at the
Marriott.

Monday AM we travel 25 minutes by historic train to Nelahozeves, home of the
Lobkowicz collection and experience one of the most amazing stories of
restitution ever told. In the PM some time on your own in Prague and to get
ready for our final evening - it will be at Prague Castle and shhhhh!, the
rest is a surprise.

As you know, Enron owns a minority interest in Hanover Compressor Corp.   On 
several ocassions, Mel Klein of GKH has discussed the possibility that Enron 
purchase GKH's interest in Hanover.  This is an option that ENA has not 
recommended to date, as I understand that at current prices we are more of a 
seller than a buyer.  Jeff Donahue is responsible for this investment and can 
answer any specific questions.

In respect to HMS,  Enron and Hanover established Hanover Measurement 
Services (HMS) as a joint venture to provide pipeline measurement services.  
HMS is structured as an (Enron:Hanover)  49:51 equity and 50:50 control 
partnership.  Enron and Hanover each have 2 representatives on the Board.

Enron (through Houston Pipe Line)  invested $2.5MM of initial capital in HMS 
and entered into a measurement service contract with HMS.  HMS has also 
entered into a service contract with Kinder Morgan and is seeking to enter 
into similar contracts with other pipelines.  

Potential HMS Topics of Discussion

1. Enron is in the processing of selling HPL - the service contract between 
HPL and HMS will be assigned to the  purchaser of HPL.  

2. Enron will retain its interest in HMS, but we are open to both Enron and 
Hanover selling a portion of our equity to a new pipeline/producer customer.

Subject: Duchess of Northumbria's request

Ken

Thanks for sending me the request from the Duchess of Northumbria for help 
with her garden project.  I have discussed this with John Wakeham and our 
view is that unless you have any other reason for helping with this, we 
should say a polite ""no"".

The background is summarised on the attached briefing note from Mike O'Neill, 
Managing Director of Lurgi Invent.

Alnwick Castle is several hundred miles out of the Wessex region so it really 
is difficult to justify any Wessex help.  Lurgi Invent has done a little work 
for the Duchess in providing water features for the garden.  However, this 
business currently loses o1 million a year so we would be reluctant to see 
any sponsorship out of Lurgi Invent.

Given the nature of the project, the approach from the Duchess and the fact 
that she can clearly afford to pay for it herself, we really do believe no is 
the right answer.

Please let me know if you want any further information or if you want me to 
correspond direct with the Duchess.

Best wishes.

Colin

Subject: Enron Omaha Community Relations Update

Cindy,
Thank you for your interest in Enron Omaha community relations initiatives. 
As you are aware, our budget is jointly managed and coordinated with Northern 
Plains. Attached for your review is a list of Enron Omaha funded health and 
human care programs serving children, teenagers, adults, families and the 
elderly. Each of these commitments have been reviewed by our employee 
activity committee and receives their full support. In fact, the 
philanthropic strategy to self-direct 50% of our corporate United Way match, 
has given our employee's a greater sense of ownership in our contribution 
decisions.


In addition, Enron Omaha has replicated the successful Houston based 
signature programs, Community 101 and PowerBlast. Our employee's also enjoy 
four Big ""E"" cafe's during the year, with the event proceeds donated to a 
United Way agency. 

Finally, your additional gift to allow Enron Omaha to actively participate in 
constructing a new city Arena and Convention center was sincerely

Dear Mr. Lay,

As you are no doubt aware your colleague Jeffrey Skilling  recently made a=
=20
keynote address at our flagship event RISK 2000 in Boston.  Building on the=
=20
success of that event, I would like to invite you to make the  keynote=20
address at Energy & Power Risk Management  Conferences=01, third annual=20
information technology event as  outlined above. This year's keynote sessio=
n=20
is entitled ""The E-Commerce Revolution: Innovations and  opportunity in the=
=20
electronic energy marketplace"". This session has no  bullet points as I wou=
ld=20
like the speaker to address only the latest issues as  they see fit. My=20
research has showed that the industry is very interested in  your opinions =
on=20
this subject and I hope you can fit this hour-long session into  you busy=
=20
schedule.

=01+Information Technology=01, will take a focused look  at the latest adva=
nces=20
being made in the energy market=01,s systems and  technologies. The confere=
nce=20
will be structured in two streams, offering  delegates and speakers the=20
chance to tailor the event to their own areas of  interest. The streams wil=
l=20
be partitioned into five areas:=20

1) Information technology for risk management

2) Information technology for pricing and trading

3) Data techniques and strategies

4) Advanced technologies for trading and risk management

5) Challenges of the evolving energy marketplace

Each of these categories will investigate the kind of problems  being faced=
=20
by energy IT/IS managers, traders and risk managers alike. I have  attached=
 a=20
copy of the program for your information. There will also be a  software=20
exhibition at the conference at which vendors will be demonstrating  their=
=20
products, as well as a post-conference seminar on data management.

This conference will be of the highly technical level that  people have com=
e=20
to expect from EPRM events, and I am very keen to encourage  participation=
=20
from speakers in modifying the program to suit the audience and  issues at=
=20
hand. If you have any suggestions or comments on the programme, please  let=
=20
me know; any help would be gratefully received.

This event will be thoroughly marketed through both Energy  & Power Risk=20
Management Magazine and our extensive database. It is my aim to  attract th=
e=20
leading market players by providing a first-class program with  top-rated=
=20
speakers, making this a highly worthwhile event for the energy  industry.

Unfortunately my schedule for this program is very tight. I  would greatly=
=20
appreciate an email soon to let me know if you would like to take  part in=
=20
this event. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to  ge=
t=20
in touch.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours sincerely,

I wasn't able to get my question to you at the all employee meeting. It was 
this:

The Enron sponsored Houston mini-cart Grand Prix entry placed second and 
received free air time of ""Enron"" on the news. With NASCAR being as popular 
as it is today, itself a multi-billion dollar industry, why hasn't Enron 
sponsored a racing team to compete against the other Fortune 500 sponsors? 
Enron is supporting stadiums, but why not a competition based on fuel, 
energy, and the most powerful being the victor?

Now with cigarettes and alcohol banned from advertising, companies such as 
AOL, Compaq, Southern Company, and Infoseek are on the tracks. Each race 
would provide more airtime of the Enron logo and further placement of ""The 
New Power Company"" in the retail consumer/viewer's venue. It would also give 
me someone to ""root"" for.

from the TFA national board members residing in Houston. TFA-H is enjoying
incredible momentum right now--so much so that we are once again in dire
need of computers. We have made contact with several companies and have some
corporate proposals under consideration, but those are ""down the road""
relationships assuming they work out as planned.   Please reach out to
anyone and everyone to make them aware of TFA-Houston and how much the
contribution of retired computers means to the disadvantaged neighborhoods
and schools that we serve.  We have a request in to Exxon Mobil Upstream
Research as I understand Exxon is replacing 40K desktops with laptops.  I
haven't been able to make headway with Exxon Mobil yet--if you can assist
with trying to obtain their retired computers, that would excellent.  This
could help our efforts across the country.

UPDATE:  We have now assisted 74 organizations and have a backlog of demand.
This Saturday, November 11, we will provide 75 computers to 4 organizations.
This will deplete our inventory.  We have several partnerships in the making
that will greatly increase the demand for our services. This week I also
participated in a meeting headed by the Mayor's office to bring the
technology and economic providers of the Enhanced Enterprise Community
together to see how we can effectively collaborate.  Judging by the interest
of my post-meeting conversations, this will also generate considerable
demand for our services.  We want to be able to deliver what we say we can
since we are now moving to the forefront of digital divide efforts in
Houston.

Thank you for your commitment and willingness to serve the cause of
eliminating the digital divide in Houston!   We are making a difference in
the lives of thousands of children and their families--let's keep moving
forward. I have attached an information sheet that you can use if you need
it as well as a list of the equipment we can use.   I have also included an
update of the progress of TFA-Houston.  Please email or call if you have
questions.

Dear Dr. Lay: 

I am pleased to invite you to join my CERA colleagues and me at our 20th 
annual Executive Conference, ""Shooting the Rapids: Strategies and Risks for 
the Energy Future"" to be held February 12-16, 2001 in Houston, Texas.? This 
is the premier international gathering offering senior executives new ideas, 
insights and strategic thinking on the issues facing the global energy 
industry.

I believe you will find the conference and related social events timely and 
of considerable value.? Our focus will be on the critical implications of the 
current market turmoil for energy strategies, investment, regulatory 
backlash, competitive dynamics, and industry structure.? Presentations cover 
all key regions and energy sectors -- oil, natural gas and power -- and their 
interconnections.? The conference is the centerpiece of CERAWeek, a full week 
of senior level meetings designed to foster exchange and learning, as well as 
informal interaction and networking.? Last year's participants included some 
1600 executives from over 57 countries.

Complete details on CERAWeek 2001 can be found at? 
http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/mc.cfm?p=670&c=150? . To register, please go

Here's a possibility.  Let me know what you think.

Dear Clayton,

Thanks for your note about our new television ad.  Our goal with the ad 
campaign is to increase Enron's familiarity and favorability with business 
and government opinion leaders.  We want to do that by communicating the 
innovative culture at Enron that always asks the question, ""Why?""  When we 
heard businesses blaming poor financial performance on their inability to 
manage weather risks, we asked, ""Why?""  We answered that with our weather 
derivatives product that helps companies protect revenues from unfavorable 
weather.  Now, many equity analysts and other investors are challenging 
companies that don't use weather derivatives as a risk management tool.

In order to get our message across in a cluttered advertising environment, we 
need to create compelling images to get that message accross.  The use of a 
traditional symbol (the old cork gun shooting gallery) applied in a 
non-traditional way (shooting down conventional wisdom) gets the point across 
very directly that traditional excuses don't ""stand up"" to today's markets.  
I think it's a powerful, and humorous, symbolic message.

I'm sorry if you're taking the reference to an old-fashioned game literally.  
I can assure you that no ducks or CEOs were harmed in the making of the 
commercial.  

Sincerely,

Joe Sutton

with additional comments on the issues and procedures.  I also had
perspective from Nancy Peretsman, who couldn't participate in the call.
There are some differing views, I know, but let me suggest the following
next steps.

First, Tim Koller and I will prepare two things to send around:

1)  A list of the key issues, together with either (a) a suggested stance
for the panel on each; or (b) a clear statement of the different approaches
we could take.

2)  An elaborated treatment of the ""intangibles"" issue, together with more
examples and a shaper definition of a proposed recommendation.

On the basis of these two papers, we will ask each of you to e-mail or fax
your comments to me, and I will circulate the entire package of views to
everyone on the panel.

Tim and I will then prepare an agenda for a face-to-face meeting for late
January or early February.  This will give us time to digest the comments,
talk to one another, etc.  Based on the comments you send me, as well as any
subsequent discussions we have, we will also be able to prepare another
draft report for the meeting, no doubt with several bracketed parts that
will include questions for the group.

Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan on Friday delivered his most forceful call
ever for that area to remain part of the larger city, then surprised the
audience by announcing that he will go to work for the Los Angeles Unified
School District when he finishes his term in office.
Speaking to a group of Valley business leaders, Riordan denounced secession
on political, moral and practical grounds, warning that it would force a tax
hike, leave the Valley with uncertain leadership and abandon the city's
poor.
""I love the Valley,"" Riordan said. ""I feel that you're part of the family,
and I don't want you to desert the family. . . . The rest of the city needs
you. You can't abandon the poor. It just isn't right.""
Riordan's pointed rejection of secession represents a significant escalation
in his efforts to head off that politically charged prospect--a topic so
heated that in a mayoral debate following Riordan's speech, not one of the
six candidates angling for election in April so much as mentioned the word.
Riordan, by contrast, tackled the issue head-on and in far more
confrontational terms than he ever has before.
""Secession,"" Riordan said bluntly, ""is a lousy idea.""
As significant as that pronouncement was, however, the mayor almost
overshadowed it with an offhand personal remark in response to a question
after his speech. Asked to elaborate on his thoughts about breaking up the
school district, Riordan let slip that he intends to go to work for L.A.
Unified after he finishes his second term as mayor, which ends next summer.
The mayor, who helped elect four of the school board's seven members, said
he has been in discussions with Supt. Roy Romer and has agreed to accept an
""executive position"" with the district next year. Riordan did not elaborate,
but in an interview later, he said he and the superintendent had agreed that
Riordan would run the district's classroom computer program.
The former Colorado governor, who now runs the city's schools, was not
immediately available for comment.
At the district, Riordan said, he will be in charge of working with schools
to make effective use of computers in the classroom. Riordan, who has
donated thousands of computers to schools in various parts of the country,
said the job fit his talents. ""I think this is something I'm good at,"" he
said. ""I know the experts in the field.""
Riordan's post-mayoral plans have for months been the object of much
speculation. Most observers predicted he would do something in the field of
education, because no topic animates Riordan as much as children and
schools.
But Riordan is a multimillionaire, and he will be over 70 when he finishes
his second term as mayor. He passed up the chance to run for governor in
1998, and some friends had predicted he would slow down when he wrapped up
his mayoral administration.
The idea of a quiet retirement, however, seems to have little appeal for
Riordan, an energetic and restless man. Asked how long he intended to take
off between finishing his work as mayor and starting his new job at the
school district, Riordan responded: ""three or four hours.""
Riordan has held office for nearly eight years, and for that entire time has
enjoyed the strong support of the San Fernando Valley. It was the Valley
that helped put him in office in 1993, and polls since have shown that
though he is popular citywide, he enjoys his greatest approval ratings north
of the Hollywood Hills.
As the race to succeed him gathers steam, some of the candidates clearly
covet Riordan's base in the Valley.
On Friday, City Councilman Joel Wachs often invoked the mayor's name during
a low-energy debate among the six leading mayoral candidates. Among other
things, Wachs praised Riordan's economic development initiatives and his
handling of the recently completed negotiations between the city and federal
government over the future of the Los Angeles Police Department.
So effusive was Wachs in his praise of Riordan that eventually businessman
Steve Soboroff complained. As Soboroff pointed out to the audience, Riordan
has endorsed his candidacy, not Wachs'. Soboroff suggested that his rival
withdraw from the race and back him instead.
Wachs laughed, but did not respond.
The debate--really more of a panel discussion in which the candidates rarely
addressed one another, while sitting cheek-by-jowl in straight-backed
chairs--also was notable as the first joint appearance of the candidates to
include state Controller Kathleen Connell, the latest contender to join the
race.
Connell used her debut debate performance to stress her determination to
bring tough fiscal management to the problems of Los Angeles. She addressed
issues such as police corruption, transportation and the city's business
climate in terms of their economic impact, arguing that her experience in
the private sector and as controller made her the right person to handle
that task.
In other debate highlights, City Atty. James Hahn and Assemblyman Antonio
Villaraigosa enthusiastically welcomed the signing of the consent decree
with the federal government on police reform.
Connell, Wachs and U.S. Rep. Xavier Becerra also applauded the deal, though
in less glowing terms.
Soboroff was the only candidate to oppose it, calling it an abdication of
local responsibility.

Economist

Washington, D.C. August 29, 2000 -- Scott Hodge has been named executive
director of the Tax Foundation. Most recently he has worked as director of
tax and budget policy at Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation and is
recognized as one of Washington's leading experts on the federal budget. He
has been widely published on fiscal policy, notably in the pages of The Wall
Street Journal, The Washington Post, USA Today, and The Washington Times.
His work as Senior Budget Analyst at the Heritage Foundation included the
editing of three books on the federal budget. Mr. Hodge has been a
commentator on nightly news shows such as NBC Nightly News and CBS Nightly
News, and has been seen regularly on CNN, Fox Network, and C-SPAN.
At the same time, Patrick Fleenor has been named the Foundation's chief
economist. On staff at the Tax Foundation since 1993, Fleenor has improved
the Foundation's core research projects, such as Tax Freedom Day and The
Federal Tax Burden by State, and he has published extensive economic
analyses of excise and estate taxes. Fleenor has a reputation among the
media as a reliable source for tax data on myriad subjects.
Hodge and Fleenor replace J.D. Foster who held both titles from 1993 to June
of this year, when he announced his departure for the staff of Rep. Phil
Crane (R-IL). Foster will be legislative director and economic counsel to
Rep. Crane, who is currently the second-ranking Republican on the House Ways
and Means Committee, and chairman of its subcommittee on trade.

Joe
 As an update to my earlier email on the Azurix water project, Azurix has 
suspended OPIC's consideration of the project until either we are able to get 
a more positive cable out of the US Embassy in Argentina or George moves on - 
probably in late January.  
 But the OPIC pullback together with the publicity about Rebecca's departure 
has caused serious concern on the part of IDB which is now pulling back.  The 
IDB has made it clear that they are concerned about Enron's intentions 
regarding Azurix.  I have talked to Azurix about seeking some statement of 
support from Enron so that we can address this issue head on.  You may well 
be getting some communication from John Garrison on this issue.  If we can 
get back on track Azurix may be able to get IDB Board approval this fall.
 Hope you are well.  thanks John

DEFECTIVE TIRES, DEFECTIVE BUREAUCRACY

Some fans of the regulatory state believe that NHTSA, the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration, deserves much credit -- and,
in reward, expanded powers -- for its role in exposing the Firestone
tire/ Ford Explorer fiasco. But although NHTSA received early reports
of fatalities caused by the separation of Firestone tires, its
investigation began very recently -- last May -- long after
investigations by State Farm Insurance, the Center for Auto Safety,
and Safety Forum brought the problem to light.

This isn't the first time that NHTSA has failed its mission, argues
Michael I. Krauss, law professor at George Mason University and
author of the recent Independent Institute book FIRE AND SMOKE:
Government, Lawsuits and the Rule of Law.

""NHTSA, the agency responsible for minimum fuel economy standards
(found by a court to have likely cost many lives by forcing
manufacturers to produce light, dangerous cars) and for
illegal-to-disable, baby-killing airbags, does not deserve to be
rewarded for its asleep-at-the-switch approach to the tire problem,""
Krauss wrote recently.

It would be absurd to reward Firestone for selling defective tires.
However, when NHTSA fails, self-proclaimed ""consumer advocates"" call
for a parallel absurdity: lavishing the agency with more regulatory
authority and taxpayer funds. But NHTSA's pattern of failure
indicates a systemic problem -- a design flaw -- that cannot be
easily repaired. In contrast, as the Firestone episode demonstrates,
the watchful eyes of the American economic and legal systems have
enormous incentives to detect and report product defects. In this
light, perhaps what most needs to be recalled and held accountable
for sloppy workmanship and false advertising is: the defective
regulatory state.

PAUL CRAIG ROBERTS ON THE WAR ON CRIME

Election-year promises always renew the risk that peaceful Americans
will see their rights sacrificed for the sake of political
expediency. This is especially true when politicians promise to ""get
tough on crime,"" as syndicated columnist and Independent Institute
research fellow Paul Craig Roberts pointed out recently.

Although one ""anti-crime"" bill (or ""anti-privacy"" according to its
critics) was recently defeated, another ""anti-crime"" bill -- this one
strengthening asset forfeiture laws -- has just been introduced.
Unfortunately, says Roberts, asset forfeiture laws violate due
process and are any easy way for politicians to look ""tough on crime""
even though such laws harm innocent Americans far more than criminals.

""The House Judiciary Committee led by Henry Hyde, R-Ill., has
documented the most extraordinary abuses of the asset forfeiture
laws,"" writes Roberts. ""The Banking Committee and [the bill's author]
should sit down with Hyde and listen carefully before they create any
more Gestapo powers for law-enforcement officers.""

MEDICARE REFORM: Economics versus Politics

Debates over Medicare reform didn't start with Al Gore and George W.
Bush. In fact, legislation similar to Medicare had been intensely
debated since the mid-1940s. However, its advocates found no way to
overcome opposition until 1965, when Medicare's staunchest advocate
on the House Ways and Means Committee found the opportunity to
smuggle Medicare legislation into another bill at the last minute.

Yet as vocal as debates over Medicare have been, very little of that
debate has been informed by sound economic principles. This omission,
which has stalled any genuine reform of Medicare, is largely the
fault of economists, says economist Robert B. Helms in the new issue
of THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW.

""My criticism is not directed to the economists who have attempted
for many years to apply market principles to health-care issues, but
to the larger number of economists who have not,"" Helms writes.
""Moreover, my criticism pertains to the failure of economists to
teach the fundamental principles of economics to educated Americans,
rather than to the failure of 'economics.'""

To improve the quality of the debate over Medicare, Helms recommends
three measures. First, more economists must explain to policymakers
and the public that that market competition in health care, as in
other markets, would improve quality of health care. Second, they
must explain that competition would also make health care more
efficient by allocating scarce resources to higher-valued uses.
Finally, they must explain that price controls and destructive of
these desirable ends.

Without a concerted effort to impart these principles to a wider
audience, Helms argues, Medicare reform -- and other necessary
health-policy reforms -- will become victim of political maneuvering,
much to the detriment of the lives and well-being of the American
public.

""This lack of education in economics is appallingly evident in
Washington, D.C., especially on Capitol Hill,"" says Helms.

Politics"" by Richard B. Helms (THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW, Fall 2000), at

I wanted to let you know that I visited Philippe Bibi last Thursday to
debrief on this loss and also to listen to a number of other points he
raised that could improve the the way we work together. Philippe was very
helpful and very direct - which I appreciate.

Some of the reasons we lost this bid is that we failed to execute the sales
process as I would expect us to. This is not typical of the way we should
now work and we have made changes to account management and service
representation.

We have made enormous progress as a Corporation over the last twelve months.
There is a lot of good news in many accounts around the world but there is
also no complacency and it concerns me a great deal when we have less than
perfect execution.

I shall be following up with Philippe and the account team to ensure we do a
great job in the future.

Peter

World Economic Forum-Mr. Nishimuro's Notes
""What should be the environmental agenda for business in the 21st
century?""

.Introduction
1. Awareness of Environmental Issue
1)   Environmental issue, like Global warming, Excessive use of
natural resources, Recycling, Pollution, is of major significance.
The impact on the business is becoming to increase.
2)   The Kyoto Conference(COP3) defined an international framework
for dealing with the issue of global warming.
(The GHG reduction targets contained in the Kyoto Protocol are 6%
for Japan, 7% for the U.S.A., 8% for the EU)
Specific content for the Flexibility Mechanism/Kyoto Mechanism
(for International Emissions Trading (IET), Joint Implement (JI),
and Clean Development Mechanism(CDM)) will be decided on at COP6,
which is scheduled for November 2000.
     GHG is a serious matter requiring a globally studying.

2. GHG Reduction
1)   The relationship between GHG levels and climatic change
remains uncertain at present and further research is required.
Policies will have to be devised that take account of developments
in scientific knowledge and opinion and that also maintains
flexibility.
2)   Policy on GHG reduction must reflect the circumstances of
each country and be based on a combination of regulatory measures,
economic measures and voluntary measures.
     Excessive regulating may cause the unfairness in business
competition.

3. Energy Conservation
1)   The U.S.A. is the largest consumer of energy. In such a
large, mobile country, much
consumption is accounted for by the transportation sector.
2)   The EU has pushed many advances in environmental protection,
and has seen considerable progress in the use of renewable energy.

3)   Japan has very limited natural resources, and energy
conservation has been promoted since the oil shocks of the 1970s.
As a result, Japan is a leader in making effective use of energy,
and has the lowest level of GHG emissions against GDP.
Japan's policy is to combine regulation with voluntary measures.
Industry has supported this by promoting voluntary environmental
plans and other measures.
Japanese industries including Toshiba are to improve the energy
consumption efficiency of their products and use of energy at
their factories.

4. Programme of Industry
1)   Energy conservation is to make up the cost reduction of
products and recycling will bring about the effect on manufacturing
cost saving in the long run.

Hello Janice:

 I enjoyed your recent e-mail but was sorry to hear about your dad.  It 
sounds as though his health has deteriorated significantly.  These are always 
difficult times.  As I watched my mother and father's health deteriorate and 
ultimately watched them die, it is a very defining time in our lives.  But we 
can be very thankful to have such great parents and to have been privilege to 
be raised in such loving homes.

 Sounds as though Eric has done very well as SMSU.  He is joining an 
excellent company.  I am also delighted to hear that he will continue his 
education working toward an MBA.  As we are living in an age were 
intellectual capital is so valuable, it is important for every young person 
to obtain the very best possible education they can.  As to our family, 
within the last ten days our youngest daughter Elizabeth was married to a 
young man from Buenos Aires, Argentina.  They met while they were both 
working on a project as lawyers in Buenos Aires.  They're currently on their 
honeymoon but shortly after returning will be moving from Buenos Aires to 
Miami, Florida.  This past Thursday night our sixth grandchild was born.  It 
was born to our son David and his wife Courtney.  It was a 7 lb., 10 oz.,  20 
inch little boy.  So we now have three grandsons and three granddaughters 
ranging from about 2 years - 4 months down to a few days.  They are a great 
deal of fun.  We are doing quite well.  I am looking forward to seeing Ginger 
""Rees"" Copeland when she comes to Houston.  I would be delighted to arrange 
tickets for you and your family should you ever have occasion to visit 
Houston.

 I hope you have a great summer.

there are a number of technical comments which we will make.  There are
about four substantive comments that we are working on and will review with
Tracey Ellison.  Two of the comments relate to you.  Goldberg wants to limit
seats to a maximum of 20 per Partner, not 300 total, because he said you
said at the meeting that each Partner would have a maximum of 20 seats.  I
didn't recall that any such statement by you was meant to limit the 300
seats but was merely an indication of about how many each Partner would
have.  Goldberg admitted the 300 seats was on the sheet handed out at the
meeting.  I can't believe Goldberg is continuing to haggle on this issue.  I
think we should say that the maximum of 300 seats is what the Partners
approved and be done with it.

The other issue is the amount of the referendum funding.  Goldberg said he
understood that the Rockets would match what the ""Partners"" would put up.
Alternatively he wants the right for the Rockets to raise part of their $1.5
million from others and get credit for it.  I'm not sure whether the Rockets
would interfere with you raising your balance of the $1.5 million.  In any
case I need your input on this issue both for the Rockets term sheet and
determining how much we need to get advanced on the loan from the Sports
Authority.

Sorry to miss you today when I called. Since I am leaving for India in a
few minutes, I thought I would sent you an E-mail, and then I can try to
call you from India. Because of the time difference, it will not be easy
for us to connect. Unfortunately I will not be back in the US until
December 7.

The reason for my call was to see if you would feel comfortable putting my
name forward to Dick Cheney for a position in the new administration. I am
not sure where the best fit would be, but it might be Chairman of the
National Economic Council. That job has a good combination of management
and economics. You know I have only been associated with Democratic
administrations in past, but Democratic administrations were a little
different in those days. You are somewhat familiar with my record on
economics and there is a lot on that in the public domain.

Just let me know what you think. Maybe a quick E-mail would suffice ( I am
carrying my computer).

Best regards,
Bill

Dear Ken,

We regret that your schedule did not permit you to visit with us this week
to discuss the Center's Global Change Program.  We do understand that the
White House probably has priority.

Rosalee indicated that you are available to meet at the Center on May 24th.
the day before the Board of Trustees meeting.  May I suggest that we invite
some members of the Steering Committee to join us on the 24th to review
where we are, the political environment, and continued Center involvement
in this program area.  As you are aware we have had discussions with the
Turner Foundation on a Leadership Forum and have developed several projects
which have each received partial funding commitments from the federal
government or private foundations.    Paul O'Neill, Tim Wirth, Bill Miller,
Teresa Heinz and Michael Oppenheimer are my suggestion of Steering
Committee members to join us.  Please give me your thoughts.

As always, Mary Hope

Attached is the agenda for Enron's upcoming Management Conference.  I've 
received valuable input from numerous members of Enron's management team and 
this is the result.  While it is quite a departure from the traditional 
conference agenda, I think it will prove to be engaging and 
thought-provoking.  I'll look forward to your input.

If you are comfortable with the agenda, I'd like to send a copy of it to the 
Executive Committee accompanied by a memo from the Office of the Chairman 
explaining the goals and objectives for the conference.  It is important that 
senior management understand the change in format and their role, if any, on 
the agenda.  (I recognize that some executives look forward to presenting at 
this conference and their absence from the agenda may be an issue for them.)

I am working with some talented people to create a slide template for all 
presenters.  We're also asking that all presenters use PowerPoint.  A 
standardized template and format will ensure that all the presentations, even 
those from external presenters, have a similar look and feel.   I'll run that 
template by you as soon as it is finalized.

Hi Rosalee-- I just wanted to thank you so much for your extra help on our
inquiry to Ken.  We understand completely that the April 25 slot following
his return from vacation is not the most ideal arrangement.  I think it's
always easiest for someone like him if he knows that a speech given recently
can easily serve as the basis for a new request.  I wanted to remind you of
my previous suggestion that his keynote presentation in Montreal last May to
the World Forum on Energy Regulation would accomplish most of that, and we
would work with Rob and others to minimize any effort required to add new
content.  Hopefully, this will help with the decision this week.  As I
mentioned the other day, Ken is really the most authoritative figure when it
comes to the idea that economic concepts can be used to build energy markets
and business enterprises that lead to better societies!  Talk soon, and
don't hesitate to ever ask for a ""quid pro quo"" from us.

introduced comprehensive legislation to shape the nation's energy policy.
``If we want to tackle [our energy] problem[s] head-on, we need a
comprehensive plan that commits to increasing domestic production and to
using energy more efficiently throughout the economy.  I believe this
legislation sets out that plan,"" Bingaman said.

Secretary Abraham Looks for Energy in Wrong Places

Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, addressing the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
noted:  =01&America faces a major energy supply crisis over the next two
decades.=018  But Abraham, like President Bush, is looking mainly to increa=
se
our supply of oil, coal, and natural gas, rather than approach both the
supply and demand sides of the issue.  Secretary Abraham mentioned energy
efficiency only once in his entire speech, even though a reduction in deman=
d
is the quickest, cleanest, cheapest (and most reliable!) energy source at
our disposal.

Senate Hearing Examines Energy-Environmental Relationship

Alliance president David Nemtzow testified at a March 21 Senate Environment
Committee Subcommittee hearing on the relationship of energy policies and
environmental policies.  Nemtzow pointed out that energy efficiency is now
our nation=01,s second largest energy source.  He also offered a series of
recommendations for the Senators simultaneously to promote energy and
environmental goals.

IPCC: Energy Efficiency is Key in Mitigating Climate Change

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released the third and
final volume of its Third Assessment Report on climate change, which
examines climate change mitigation strategies and places a heavy emphasis o=
n
using energy wisely. The report finds that energy efficiency for buildings,
transportation, and industry could account for more than half of the
potential greenhouse gas reductions achievable by 2020. Natural gas
technologies, more efficient power plant technologies, and combined heat an=
d
power play an important role in reducing fossil energy power plant
emissions. And ""low-carbon energy systems,"" such as renewable energy, can
also make an important contribution. Perhaps equally important is the
finding that there is ""no single path to a low emission future.""

Barriers to Energy Efficiency In Public, Private Organizations

There is a gap between the opportunities for cost-effective energy-
efficiency investment identified in energy models and the levels actually
seen in practice, according to SPRU, a science and technology policy
research group in England. The origins of the gap are claimed to lie in a
series of barriers, such as lack of capital, lack of information or hidden
costs, which prevent markets for energy and energy-using technologies from
operating efficiently.  SPRU says that understanding the size and nature of
this gap is essential if policies to mitigate climate change through
improved energy efficiency are to be successful. These policies must succee=
d
in the context of liberalizing energy markets and increasing interest in th=
e
development of a broadly based energy service industry.

Dallas Cleans the Air with the IECC Energy Code

The North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG) voted this month to
adopt the 2000 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) for the Dallas
region.  This area accounts for almost 50,000 housing starts a year, more
than are built in 42 states.  One of the main reasons for adopting the code
is the area's commitment to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions as part of the
Texas state plan for controlling smog.  Since the IECC contains a new
standard for reducing window solar heat gain, which reduces air conditionin=
g
energy use substantially, it cuts NOx emissions from the power plants that
serve the air conditioning load.  The Alliance supported Public Citizen, th=
e
Texas Building Energy Institute, the Sustainable Living Alliance, NCTCOG
staff, and others in this effort, working with the Building Codes Assistanc=

EYE OPENERS

Energy Efficiency Facts Even Children Can Understand

A vacant house at 55 Fahrenheit uses more energy for heating than an
occupied one at 68 Fahrenheit, according to GPU Energy.  The activity in an
occupied house radiates a certain amount of heat and some of the energy
users in your home are still operating while you areaway. Designed
specifically for teachers and students, the GPU website features
energy-related games, activities, experiments, downloadable teaching
modules, and lesson plans on a variety of energy, electrical safety, energy

Subject: Duchess of Northumbria's request

Ken

Thanks for sending me the request from the Duchess of Northumbria for help 
with her garden project.  I have discussed this with John Wakeham and our 
view is that unless you have any other reason for helping with this, we 
should say a polite ""no"".

The background is summarised on the attached briefing note from Mike O'Neill, 
Managing Director of Lurgi Invent.

Alnwick Castle is several hundred miles out of the Wessex region so it really 
is difficult to justify any Wessex help.  Lurgi Invent has done a little work 
for the Duchess in providing water features for the garden.  However, this 
business currently loses o1 million a year so we would be reluctant to see 
any sponsorship out of Lurgi Invent.

Given the nature of the project, the approach from the Duchess and the fact 
that she can clearly afford to pay for it herself, we really do believe no is 
the right answer.

Please let me know if you want any further information or if you want me to 
correspond direct with the Duchess.

Best wishes.

Colin

> Cross Border Office files first lawsuit
> The Cross Border Office has been created to prevent unauthorized movement
> of Compaq products by dealers and gray market brokers in order to protect
> profit margins and ultimately, customer satisfaction.  The Cross Border
> team provides gray market awareness training to all sales personnel, mail
> and phone hotline access to report gray market activity, works jointly
> with regional sales, services, business unit and channel teams to create
> policy and procedures to reduce gray market activity and, working with the
> Law department, to bring legal action against gray market brokers if
> warranted.
>
> As a result of these efforts, Compaq has filed its first lawsuit against
> two Canadian technology consulting firms for breach of contract and fraud.
> The suit, which seeks compensatory damages of more than $17 million,
> claims the consulting firms fraudulently represented to Compaq that they
> had a contract with the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal
> Aviation Administration to supply a large number of computers and related
> equipment to U.S. airports. This lawsuit hit many national publications
> and sends a message to the worldwide gray market community that Compaq
> will take actions to protect its authorized resellers, product quality and
> our customers.

> the regions.
>
> Worldwide implementation of ILP is a top priority for the company.
> Creating and publishing (where needed) competitive List Prices is
> absolutely essential to establishing a more consistent, worldwide pricing

>
> The Compaq Agent Program, which allows partners to earn commissions when
> they refer customers to purchase products/services directly from us,
> currently has been implemented in the U.S., Latin America (14 countries)
> and CKK.  This month, APD is implementing pilot programs in Singapore and
> Malaysia, and plans to roll out the program in seven additional countries

		 Subject: i2 NETWORK DEAL IS SIGNED !

Hello --

We have i2's signature on the VBN network contract.  The contract is a 3-year 
VBN deal covering certain i2 locations in the U.S., Europe, Asia, and India.  
The TCV of the deal is $14.8 million.

This is one of the first major external VBN deals for Enron and has been 
instrumental in shaping the VBN offering.  It also brings an anchor network 
client to our Tokyo and India sites.  The interactions with i2 on this 
agreement have also contributed to our understanding of which BOS features 
are most desired by customers.

The i2 deal is the result of a lot of hard work and persistence by a number 
of folks throughout EBS and other Enron groups.  Just about everyone in EBS' 
Technology Channels Group contributed to the i2/Enron relationship that 
culminated in the network deal.  Particular thanks to Mike Haney who led the 
team through multiple iterations of the deal structure.  Special thanks to 
David Berberian, Erin Wesling, and Brad Harris who spent lots of time on the 
contract and the network design work with i2.  Thanks also to LaRence 
Snowden, Tony Gilmore, and Beaven Fernandez of TDS, Steve McCarrel of Legal, 
Wayne Gardner of Tax, and Laura Leibman of Regulatory who helped throughout 
the course of the deal structuring and to  Everett Plante, Larry Ciscon, and 
Kenny Burroughs and their teams who provided input on BOS and network 
topics.  In addition, thanks to the Enron India team who supported the deal 
throughout the design and negotiation process.

i2 has remarked often on the professionalism and collaborative spirit of the 
Enron team throughout this process.  Enron is now i2's preferred network 
provider, and we are poised to provide the rest of i2's data network 
worldwide as soon as the design specifications are completed by i2.  Thanks 
again to the entire team on your success.  Best regards.

Subject: OK, Jeff, you requested that we be candid about Enron...

""Management does things right; Leadership does the right things."" (Peter 
Drucker)

Today I began to wonder if I've been a fool in staunchly defending Enron's 
Visions & Values. 

An esteemed colleague of very strong professional reputation at Enron was 
recently approached by a hiring supervisor.  Totally unexpected & 
unsolicited, an offer was accepted; all seemed well as this Recruit got good 
feedback directly from clients & Enron upper mgmt.  But after a short time, 
suddenly Recruit was told that performance was unsatisfactory.  No specific 
behaviors or problems were identified as cause; no opportunity given to 
modify; Recruit was summarily removed to another floor with instructions to 
find another job.  Upon displacement she told me (~6 weeks ago), ""I want 
avoid trouble for anyone; I just want to continue quietly at Enron and forget 
this.""  

To date I have honored her request for silence, but all this hullabaloo about 
Enron being the best place to work makes her dilemma particularly upsetting, 
and there is ample evidence that her plight is not unique.  I refer here to 
Cindy Adams, formerly of Joe Sutton's office.  I don't care why it was 
decided not to use HR's counseling/review process designed to help when 
things go awry; I just know that Enron's best bet is to give this talented 
professional more time.  She writes:

...Last week, my HR Rep informed me that I have a deadline of July 15th in 
which to find a job...I have no assistance from HR or Recruiting.  I had 2 
interviews 5 weeks ago and I had to initiate those myself.  I've not received 
answers from postings I've responded to - I am left hanging without 
acknowledgment of any sort.

I have been approached and learned from others that the same thing happened 
to them with the same circumstances; one said that it took her a full 3 
months to land her present job.  I am not afforded that opportunity now ...

Jeff, would you please ask someone to remove Cindy's July 15 deadline?  There 
are no rules left to break here; Cindy is trying to proceed diligently & 
discreetly, but she is under duress by not having any feedback/support from 
HR.   With a little boost, it's not too late to bring this picture into line 
with Enron's vision of retaining topnotch people.  

Cindy has no idea that I'm writing on her behalf, and after this I intend to 
honor her wishes with silence.  But you must see the irony here, not to 
mention the double standard in how Enron's Visions & Values are applied to 
assistants all over Enron:  Cindy Adams was sought after, then abruptly put 
out of the office of Joe Sutton, who happens to be our V&V expert!  I'm not 
blaming Joe for anything; he is simply the backdrop in this example.  I 
remember Joe once used an expression at a floor meeting:  ""believing your own 
baloney.""  He wasn't talking about Visions & Values then, but ""believing 
baloney"" suddenly seems to fit for assistants who work at Enron.  You asked 
for candid; herein I have done my very best to give it to you.

Jeff, thanks for asking and listening.  I and my colleagues are listening 
too, but seeing is believing.

Respectfully submitted,

Betty Alexander

Please forward to Kenneth Lay-CEO:
 
Dear Mr. Lay,
 
It's rare that I write fan letters, but I just saw your interview on CNBC 
Squawk Box. I was very impressed with your positive message and enthusiasm 
about Enron's e-commerce platform.  
 
Thank you for the informative exchange, it was a pleasure to hear your 
refreshing outlook this early in the morning.  Those folks at CNBC can be 
tough on CEO's.
 
Prompted to visit your web site, I was impressed with Enron's worldwide 
diversity. A Texas Aggie '69, I'm proud to see a Texas company with such 
powerful skills and resources.
 
Congratulations, you represented your company very well to a worldwide TV 
audience.
 
Warmest regards,

These meetings that were set up with Pawar in Delhi were supposed to be 
attended by Wade but but he was unable to attend them due to the fact that he 
fell sick. No agreements have been reached because there are none that are 
contemplated. All we have done is to encourage the GOM to approach the GOI 
for reducing their own liabilities. The details you will find in the other 
memo I have already sent to you. (I picked up your email after I finished 
sending my emails).  The approach as u will notice is no different than what 
we have been following all along and I believe that  you know that already.  
If u want further clarification, I am happy to discuss this with you or if u 
want to follow a different strategy then please let me know. I am at the 
Delhi Oberoi at  91-11-4363030, room 716.

Ken had expressed to me last week that you desired to take charge immediately 
and start moving the resolution of the Dabhol issues forward. I agree that 
this will be the best way forward. Given the way things are moving, I think 
that it would be best  that you arrive in Delhi immediately over the weekend 
so that I can introduce you to the players on Monday and start transitioning 
the relationships to you and Wade. Wade will join the team in delhi as soon 
as he is able to travel. Tuesday onwards I have urgent commitments in Mumbai 
that require my presence there.

As you can appreciate, your presence in these meetings will be essential for 
you to start getting a feel for the situation on the ground and developing 
the rapport with the key players. The GOM is clearly driving the train and if 
we are to assist them its essential that we not slow them down and assist 
them in any way we can.

Sanjay

Sanjay,

Through several forwardings of memos it has come to my attention that you had 
several meetings this week with Sharad Pawar and reached some agreements.  I 
understand that a conference call to generate a strategy regarding our 
approach to Mr Pawar was cancelled and no one is able to explain to me what 
approach  you took or what the nature is of any agreements or accomodations 
that you may have struck in these meetings.  I think it is important that I 
and the rest of the task force be involved in the setting of strategy even if 
we will call on you to conduct any of the discussions and it is clear that it 
is cooperation and coordination is paramount.

Please call or write immediately with a briefing of those meetings and of any 
agreements that were agreed to.  In the future, I would appreciate better 
coordination and discussions on all matter related to Dabhol and to Metgas.  
I am available by phone day or night.

Regards
Rebecca

Hello Mr. Lay,

It's been a long time since we've talked.  I'm Priscilla Slade, President of
Texas Southern University.  The primary purpose of this e-mail is to invite
you to attend a weekend at the home of President and Mrs. Bush September
16-18.  So many people have expressed a desire to become know more about the
University (it's new initiatives and successes) that  President Bush
volunteered to host a gathering of 25 CEOs and spouses (or a second person
in the corporate hierarchy).  In addition to having fun golfing, sailing,
boating, etc., we are presenting ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT TEXAS SOUTHERN
UNIVERSITY.

I know this is your favorite topic and that we can look forward to you
joining us.  An invitation is in the mail.  I look forward to you joining

returning to the theme that Governor Bush=02=07s Texas has become an abysma=

to live. It is a hard case to make=02=05Texas is today the fifth fastest gr=
owing=20
state and fifth in net influx of Americans from other states, and Mr. Bush =
is=20
one of the nation=02=07s most popular governors.
 Mr. Gore=02=07s earlier attacks on the governor=02=07s education record we=
re set aside=20
following the July release of a comprehensive RAND study showing that Texas=
=20
has become the nation=02=07s top state in achievement test scores. His subs=
equent=20
assertions about the number of Texans lacking health insurance seem to have=
=20
fizzled as well (it turns out that the number of uninsured has been falling=

in Texas while rising in the nation as a whole). That leaves environmental=
=20
quality, where the Vice President and his ad writers have leveled a fusilla=
de=20
of dramatic allegations about increasing pollution in Texas=02=07s cities a=
nd=20
streams.
 Environmental quality presents rich opportunities for misleading data and=
=20
rhetoric. Measuring air and water pollution involves a host of variables: o=
ne=20
can measure pollution by emissions or by the quality of the air and water,=
=20
and measurements of air and water quality depend on the placement of=20
monitors, the use of *peak* versus average levels, and adjustments for=20
population exposure and for the widely differing health and amenity effects=
=20
of different kinds of pollution. Rankings among states are much more=20
problematic than rankings of school performance or health care, because all=
=20
states that are more urbanized and industrialized have higher pollution=20
levels. Texas accounts for 60 percent of the nation=02=07s petrochemical=20
production capacity and 25 percent of oil refining, and it is the only stat=
e=20
with two metropolitan areas (Houston and Dallas-Ft. Worth) among the nation=
=02=07s=20
top ten. Measured by simple gross quantities, Texas, California, and New=20
Jersey will have *more pollution* than most other states under any=20
circumstances; the rest of us can enjoy the products without having to both=
er=20
so much with the pollution-control challenges.
 Mr. Gore=02=07s charges exploit these opportunities to the hilt, combining=
=20
misleading statistics with a few outright fabrications to create an=20
impression that bears little relationship to reality. The charges are,=20
however, easy to debunk, and it is surprising that they been reported with=
=20
little scrutiny by a media that has otherwise grown wary of the Vice=20
President=02=07s loose ways with facts.
 The Gore campaign=02=07s favorite charge is that Houston has passed Los An=
geles=20
to become *the smog capital of the United States,* *No. 1 in air pollution,=
*=20
and *the dirtiest city in the nation.* (We will ignore Democratic National=
=20
Committee Chairman Joe Andrew=02=07s claim that Houston has become *the dir=
tiest=20
city in the world,* which was evidently uttered in a fit of enthusiasm for=
=20
the latest party line.) The charge is false. According to the U.S.=20
Environmental Protection Agency, air quality in Houston is improving and is=
=20
unambiguously better than in Los Angeles, and is also better than in many=
=20
other cities.
 The Houston charge is based on 1999 city data on ambient levels of ozone=
=02=05one=20
of six *criteria* air pollutants regulated under the national Clean Air Act=
=02=05
as measured by numbers of days of *exceedences*of the EPA=02=07s national=
=20
standard. Ozone levels are highly sensitive to weather conditions, especial=
ly=20
temperature. They have been essentially flat in Houston in recent years (an=
d=20
other southern cities such as Atlanta), but they fell sharply in Los Angele=
s=20
in 1999 due to unusually cool summer weather. As a result, Houston topped L=

nevertheless better than LA=02=07s. Houston=02=07s ozone level was 10 perce=

than in Los Angeles, but its particulates level was 20 percent lower=20
(particulates are the other major component of *smog,* and according to the=

identical). While Houston was out of compliance with EPA=02=07s national st=
andard=20
for only one pollutant, ozone, LA was out of compliance for three: ozone,=

particulates, and carbon monoxide.
 We hasten to add that we are comparing Houston with Los Angeles only to=20
demonstrate the falsity of Mr. Gore=02=07s allegation. If Houston is not nu=
mber=20
one in air pollution, neither is it number two or even number six (Houston =
is=20
the nation=02=07s sixth largest metropolitan area).  According to the EPA A=
ir=20
Quality Index, which aggregates levels of all six air pollutants and weight=

them according to the health risks of each, air quality in Houston is bette=

than in ten other metropolitan areas. Houston also bests ten other cities o=

a separate EPA index of ozone alone. (These data are for 1998, the most=20

)
 A related charge, and particularly egregious falsehood, is Vice President=
=20
Gore=02=07s assertion that Governor Bush *made key air pollution rules in T=

voluntary.* In 1999, Governor Bush signed two laws concerned with=20
*grandfathered* sources of air pollution. Under the Clean Air Act and almos=

inducing firms to maintain old facilities (both less efficient and more=20

protracted litigation over the difference between renovating an old facilit=

and building a new one. Under the 1999 legislation, Texas became one of the=

for old facilities. The step was praised by environmental groups and helped=

coax Mr. Gore, who had not previously confronted the problem as a legislato=
r=20
or Vice President, to propose a national program of his own for old power=
=20
plants. (Mr. Bush has also advanced a national proposal.)
 But there was a wrinkle in the Texas initiative: the law covering utilitie=
s=20
enacted mandatory standards (which will result in huge reductions in power=
=20
plant emissions over the next three years), but the law covering industrial=
=20
facilities enacted a *voluntary* compliance schedule coupled with increased=
=20
fees for noncompliance. There is legitimate disagreement over just how=20
effective the fee-incentive program will turn out to be; there have been so=
me=20
initial reductions in the first year, apparently of about 25,000 tons of ai=
r=20
pollution, but the program is too recent to estimate likely future=20
reductions. What is not in dispute is that both the *mandatory* and=20
*voluntary* prongs of the Texas program constitute an extension and=20
tightening of air pollution controls=02=05and an innovation that powerful b=

opposition has thwarted at the national level and in most states. Nor is it=

disputed that the use of economic incentives rather than regulatory mandate=
s=20
may significantly improve the effectiveness of our environmental laws and a=
re=20
worth a try; indeed, that is precisely the approach of the Vice President=
=02=07s=20
national proposal for old utilities, which consists not of mandatory=20
standards but *voluntary* tax incentives.
 For Mr. Gore=02=05a self-described environmentalist and reformer=02=05now =
to turn on=20
the Texas reforms and describe them as having weakened existing pollution=
=20
standards (*Bush made key air pollution rules voluntary*) is an act of=20

twist: it couples the *made voluntary* fabrication with the Houston air=20
quality fabrication to produce a triple falsehood=02=05that air pollution g=
ot=20
worse in Houston because Governor Bush weakened air pollution standards.
 The Vice President=02=07s most plenary change is that, under Governor Bush=
, Texas=20
has become *last among all states in air quality,* *No. 1 in industrial air=
=20
pollution,* and *No. 3 in water pollution.* Although the Gore campaign has=
=20
occasionally relied on newspaper articles and rankings produced by=20
environmental groups, its primary and only official source for these claims=
=20
is an EPA compilation called the Toxics Release Inventory. The TRI, however=
,=20
is not a useful measure of air or water pollution and is not a measure of=
=20
environmental quality at all. Instead, it measures *releases* of certain=20
substances that the EPA classifies as toxic=02=05and *releases* includes no=
t only=20
those that pollute the air and water but also those that are properly=20
disposed of through EPA-approved hazardous waste management and water=20

imates=20
*reflect releases and other waste management activities of chemicals, not=
=20
exposures of the public to those chemicals,* and that they are not sufficie=
nt=20
to determine exposure or harm to the environment or public health.
 So the TRI numbers cannot possibly support Mr. Gore=02=07s assertions. But=
 even=20
in their own terms, they tell a story that is the opposite of what the Vice=
=20
President would like voters to believe. Texas has always been near the top =
of=20
the various TRI ratings, reflecting the state=02=07s huge share of national=
=20
petrochemical and refining capacity. But it did not become No. 1 in the=20
overall ranking under Governor Bush, as the Gore campaign insinuates. Rathe=
r,=20
Texas was No. 1 under Mr. Bush=02=07s predecessor, Democratic Governor Ann=
=20
Richards, and it has improved significantly since he took office. The EPA=
=02=07s=20
1999 release of TRI data through 1997 noted that *Texas, the state with the=

finds Texas leading all other states in energy recovery and waste treatment=

and second in on-site recycling. Due in part to these improvements, Texas h=

 Environmental quality in Texas has improved under Governor Bush according =

 Ed Hugetz has provided the information below in response to your
inquiry about bandwidth.  It appears that at least for us, there is no pot
of gold at the end of the bandwidth rainbow.  One wonders about the decision
that was apparently make in the early 1990s to decline this opportunity.
However, we will continue to look into the matter.

Subject: RE: UH bandwidth



Art -

This afternoon I spoke to Jeff Clarke about Gary Rosenthal's emails
regarding bandwidth.  Jeff has been in Washington this week and he had the
opportunity to talk to Todd Gray, who is our telecommunications lawyer at
Dow Lohnes.  Todd is very familiar with the Wall Street Journal article -
the writers interviewed him extensively.  He told Jeff that what was not
made clear in the article was that the class of spectrum that they were
referring to was the ITFS spectrum.  The UH System does not own any
bandwidth in this spectrum.  The broadcast spectrum that KUHT uses is in a
different class.  In the early 90's the System had the opportunity to
acquire a license for ITFS spectrum and declined.

The ITFS spectrum is a closed circuit system that covers a relatively small
radius of 10-20 miles.  It is bandwidth that is very attractive to wireless
companies, however, Todd does not think there is nearly the ""gold mine"" for
universities that own the spectrum as indicated in the article.

When Dennis Duffy returns on Monday, he and I will call Todd Gray to get
further details.

Ken,

I hope things are well with you.

I've taken on in the last year of my 6 year term the regents' chairmanship
and so I am busy working on how to help further accelerate the good things
that have occurred since we brought Art and his team to Houston.  In this
light, I read the recent article in the Wall Street Journal suggesting that
the Kuht-TV spectrum allotment includes substantial unused bandwidth which
we are legally permitted to lease to the private sector.  The Journal, based
on the recent UK auction, extrapolated the overall worth of the bandwidth at
$160 billion.  Needless to say, if we could realize a small fraction of
that, for something from which we currently derive nothing, it could be a
huge boost to our efforts to obtain the additional funding we need as we
move to Tier One status.

Since Enron is the leader in the market for bandwidth, I was hoping you or
someone at Enron could give us some advice on what we own, its value, if
any, and how we might think about realizing on any such value.  From Enron's
perspective, perhaps there is a niche market for Enron to make by helping
organize educational institutions that own such bandwidth to exploit the
value of that asset.

Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards.

Gary

On behalf of Assistant Secretary of Defense (C3I) and DoD CIO Arthur Money,
I would like to invite you to participate in the Secretary of Defense's
Highlands Forum. The Highlands Forum is a cross-disciplinary group of
eminent scholars, researchers, CEO's/CIO's/CTO's from industry, and leaders
from the media, the arts and the professions, who have met over the past six
years to examine areas of emerging interest to all of us.  The idea is to
gain a better understanding of the new environment we will all be living and
working in, and to examine the fundamental changes that will impact that
environment.  The Forum includes seniors from the White House, Defense, and
other agencies of government (we limit government participation to about
25%).  Our meetings over the past six years have covered such diverse topics
as ""The Mind, the Brain, and Computing""; ""The Convergence of Information
Technology and Biotechnology""; and ""Innovation in Public Sector
Organizations"".  Our meeting in May explored MEMS, nanotechnology, and
molecular computing; among our participants were: Sun Microsystems founder
Bill Joy, Phil Kuekes of HP, Nobel laureate Rick Smalley. Our last meeting
in September focused on the future of software, and participants included
Inktomi founder Eric Brewer, SUN CTO Greg Papadopoulos, Packet Design CEO
Judy Estrin (board member of FedEx and Cisco), and Esther Dyson.

The Forum is an idea engine--there are no reports and no consensus
recommendations. Meeting size is usually kept to around 30 people to remain
small and informal, encouraging maximum discussion of ideas presented by a
speaker or a panel; we call it strategic conversation.  While there is media
participation in our meetings, there is no press coverage of the
discussions.  Our distinguised media participants in this meeting (CEO, UPI;
Exec. Editor, International Herald Tribune) will take part representing
themselves and will  act as moderators.

Several of our participants strongly suggested that I contact you to tell
you about the Forum and this particular meeting. We are going to hold
Highlands Forum 16 in Washington, DC, on December 14-15 (half day on the
15th).  The topic will be built around the search for
information/transformation strategies for the Department of Defense (and
government in general). The Assistant Secretary would like to hold this
Highlands to think about the elements of an information strategy, and I have
suggested that we look at information and strategy from a business
perspective (transformation, productivity, competitive advantage).  We will
look at  4 or 5 useful business cases for context.  ENRON is a remarkable
example of transformation in a highly rigid, regulated industry, that has
created a new model and new markets.

The Defense Department is not only creating an operational strategy which
has information superiority (better, faster decision making) at its core;
the Department also has an enormous global business enterprise which can
benefit from many of the best practices and ideas from industry enabling it
to achieve greater efficiencies and be a better steward of public funds.
Clearly, not all the elements translate well from the business envrionment,
however, many do.  I am interested in business cases which ideally describe
an enterprise-level information or transformation strategy--those which see
an information strategy as the overarching strategy, or at least as a core
component of corporate/operational strategy--use of information technology,
information protection/assurance, CRM, and perhaps how to use information
and technology to transition or capture or create a new market. One
operational example that we will look at is Cemex, the Mexican cement
company that uses I.T. (GPS and communications) to ""swarm"" its trucks in the
ready cement business. Their COO will be joining us to describe how they
succeeded in dominating their market. In addition to Cemex, other companies
represented in our agenda include Cisco, eBay, Schwab, and Sourceree.

ENRON is of great interest to us.  What we learn from you may help the
Department of Defense a great deal as it works to build a new strategy. I
hope that you have time on your busy schedule to join us for as much of the
Highlands Forum as you can attend and speak with the group. I would be happy
to tell you more about the Forum.  In the meantime, please take a look at
the Secretary's Website for the Forum to get a better idea of what it is and
what is has accomplished: www.hlforum.com; username: cc27 (lowercase);
password: SVN8 (Uppercase). I am also attaching a short document which gives
a bit more information about the Forum.

Justin is an engineer based in the Portland office and is helping us in the 
technical due diligence of Zambeel and possibly Intellinet.  He is quite 
knowledgable about storage technology as he is evaluating storage products 
for our commercial purposes.  FYI, he is meeting with Zambeel's engineering

Enron Transportation Services Company (ETS) and El Paso Gas Pipeline Company 
(El Paso) have entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to jointly 
analyze and develop an Alaskan Natural Gas Pipeline Project (tentatively 
named North Star Pipeline).  Both parties did not want to press release the 
MOU.

The MOU only commits us to jointly study, evaluate and fund a project 
proposal.  It can be canceled at any time, for any reason, and is not an 
exclusive.

The ""Alaskan Producers"" are telling us they want to team-up with someone who 
can help them get the gas to the markets.  Four (4) Bcf of incremental 
supplies just cannot be directed to a market hub...i.e., Chicago, for 
instance.

Our goal with El Paso is to develop a joint market assessment of where the 
demand for incremental supplies is needed and then develop a total project 
that would get the gas to the various markets.

Our ownership of NNG, TW and NBPL and El Paso's ownership of ANR, El Paso and 
Tennessee will cover a lot of impacted pipelines.

I believe our best bet as of now is not to commit to a specific route or 
project (i.e., Hoglund's), but work with the producers on a total delivery 
system...wellhead to city gate/burner tip.

Your thoughts would be appreciated before we move too far in this direction.

Stan

P.S.  My guess is we would look at a 10% to 15% interest in a project 
financed (75%) pipeline.

Society banquet program this Friday night.  At the end of this e-mail is
your portion of the ""script"" for this event.  The entire script will be in a
notebook at the podium.

Besides introductions (primarily some of our students who will be there),
the program will include remarks from the chancellor, the induction of new
members of the Society, announcements of other large new gifts, and some
musical entertainment.  Jack and Mary Bush of Dallas, Texas are co-chairs of
the Davenport Society this year.  Both are MU alums.  Jack retired several
years ago as president of Michaels Store, the large arts-and-crafts
retailer; he's now involved in retail and e-commerce consulting.

We will have at least 225 alumni, business people from the area, university
leaders, faculty, staff, and students in attendance.  A couple reminders:
It is black tie.  And the event is being held at the Reynolds Alumni Center
on campus, with reception at 6 and dinner at 7.  We intend/hope to end by
9:30.

You will be introduced by Jack Bush.  As you can see below, we have allotted
about 10 minutes for the keynote talk.  The starting time for your talk is
approximate, but we strive to stay on schedule.  Last Friday, I responded to
an e-mail from Rob Bradley regarding your keynote talk.  He indicated that
he would be preparing the talk.  (Rob, would you confirm that you received
my e-mail of last Friday.  Thanks.)

Then we will have another 10 minutes or so devoted to the announcement of
the Pinkney Walker Professorship.  As you can see, I'll introduce this part
after thanking you for your keynote remarks.  The professorship plaque that
will hang in the foyer of Middlebush Hall (and, soon, Cornell Hall) has
arrived so we will be able to show it to the audience and to Pinkney.  We'll
have it on stage and I'll hold it while you read the wording (see below).

If you desire, you can add personal comments about Pinkney after reading the
inscription on the plaque.  If you want them placed in the podium script,
just have them sent to me via e-mail; likewise, with any changes or
corrections to the portion below.  Of course, you can speak extemporaneously
about Pinkney or bring prepared remarks about him with you.  Then we'll
allow Pinkney to say a few words.  It should be splendid.

By the way, during the dinner, you will be seated with Pinkney and his wife
Sheila, Dulari Mehta (a College of Business student from the Dallas area who
is hosting the Walkers, who are new Davenport Society members), Richard
Schwartz (dean of A&S), and Michael Kateman and Lindsay Lopez (both from the
A&S development office)

Of course, if you, Rob, or Rosalee have questions, you can call either my
assistant Carol Ritter or me at 573/882-6688.  See you Friday evening.
Thanks again.


8:21 - 8:31  KEYNOTE ADDRESS

Ken Lay:  [remarks]

[Bruce Walker joins Lay at podium.]


8:31 - 8:36  ANNOUNCEMENT OF P. WALKER PROFESSORSHIP

Bruce Walker: Thank you very much, Ken.

We are truly honored and grateful that you have returned to Mizzou this
evening.

At this banquet two years ago, Ken announced the start of a campaign to
establish an endowment in the College of Business in honor of Pinkney C.
Walker.

Ken, along with Harold Hook and Bob Pugh, agreed to lead the effort to raise
funds for this endowment.

Pinkney, would you please come up and join Ken and me.

Many of you are familiar with Pinkney.

Those of you who don't know Pinkney probably have 2 questions in mind.

Are these two Walker guys related?

And the answer is no.

Why does Pinkney Walker deserve such as honor?

Well, let me tell you a little bit about him.

A native of Graham, Texas, Pinkney's academic degrees include a bachelor's
from the University of Texas and an MBA and a doctorate from the Wharton
School at the University of Pennsylvania.

Pinkney's association with MU dates back to 1940.

Eventually, he became a professor of economics, who -- according to one
estimate -- taught as many as 40,000 students at Mizzou.

Pinkney also served as the college's dean from 1964 to 1971.

He left the university to become a member of the Federal Power Commission.

Now, he is enjoying the good life of a professor emeritus, residing in Fort
Myers, Florida, with his wife Sheila.

We knew the Pinkney C. Walker Endowment would be dedicated to building
excellence in the college.

But we didn't know if the endowment eventually would fund a scholarship or
two, faculty research, or a faculty position.

That would depend on how much money was raised.

Well, tonight, as Paul Harvey would say, Ken is back with the rest of the
story.

Ken. . .


Ken Lay: It is with great pride and pleasure that I can tell you
tonight that the Pinkney C. Walker Endowment has received gifts totaling
$550,000, which means it will fund a distinguished professorship in the
college.

Here is the plaque that will hang in Middlebush Hall and eventually will be
moved to Cornell Hall.

It reads:

Pinkney C. Walker Distinguished Teaching Professorship
College of Business

Established in recognition of Dr. Walker's teaching excellence
and his significant contributions as dean, public servant, and friend.

Endowed in 2000 by alumni and friends of the University of Missouri.

Pinkney, please accept our congratulations.

Would you like to say a few words.

(8) we currently hold.? In order to  give you some background, Linda checked 
other peer companies and the meetings  range from 6 to 8 a year.? 
?
I think that we can cut back to 6,  however it may be more prudent to drop to 
7 this year and first see how it goes  .? The two meetings that can be 
dropped most easily are June or  September.? 
?
June,  because we have the two day strat  plan meeting in July, and Sept. 
because we don't yet have 4th quarter results  and not a lot of new 
information is available.
?
I think that the board meetings take up   an incredible amount of Compaq 
executive time and energy. I would rather have  them concentrate on getting 6 
or 7 meetings right, getting the company back on  track and? increasing 
earnings.? So, my vote is to?recommend to the board that we  eliminate the 
September '01 meeting.? That is a particularly busy month for  many people as 
exhibited by the lack of attendance we had at this past September  meeting (5 
members).? In looking back, we seem to be able to ""fill the  house"" in June.

Donahue regarding increasing Enron's contribution to the US Chamber to 
$100,000.  I have been giving the Chamber a bit of a hard time lately and 
wanted you to know why.

I have been in touch with both Tom and his staff over the last year.  Donahue 
has done a very good job raising money and getting his membership rolls up, 
both in terms of membership and dollar contribution per member.  My 
reservation about the Chamber is that they won't take a stand on something 
which is in the best interests of the vast majority of their membership if it 
will alienate a vocal few.  Electric restructuring was a key example of 
this.  There was no doubt where they should have been on the issue, but 
instead of embracing retail open access legislation at the federal level they 
decided to have a ""process"".  Naturally, all the utilities volunteered to 
participate in the process and outnumbered the nonutility members when it 
came time to vote.  The vote supported wholesale, but not retail, reform 
(with heavy emphasis on ensuring stranded cost recovery).  Afterwards, the 
federal debate shifted solely to wholesale legislation (though this is not 
exclusively the Chamber's fault).

Unfortunately, Tom's forceful and competitive approach when it comes to 
raising his membership rolls leaves him unwilling to do the right thing if a 
few members will be upset.  For Enron it's a bit like paying $100,000 for a 
veto right.  The only things the organization pushes for are the things 
everyone agrees on in the business community -- eg China PNTR and lower 
corporate taxes -- things they will push for whether we pay dues or not (and 
things we will add our separate voice to in any event).  

As I have explained to the Chamber, Enron makes its money challenging 
conventional wisdom, changing the way markets work, and dislocating 
incumbents.  Anything important that we stand for is likely to alienate some 
members of the business community and the Chamber is unlikely to stand with 
us.  They represent the status quo in the business community.  Tom is an 
extremely promising leader; he needs to create a new kind of voice for the 
business community.  A voice which stands for moving business to the next 
level, not just protecting its current position.

Having said all that, the Chamber (particularly its international chapters) 
has been useful to us in the past.  In previous years, Donahue himself has 
intervened on our behalf with Latin American leaders.  As a consequence, I 
have asked them for a proposal which would allow us to remain Chamber members 
at a lower dues (and policy participation) level, but with continuing access 
to their international activities.  I suggested something in the $25,000 
range.  That's why they are approaching you (they want us to double our 
current dues to $100,000).

Currently, I am inclined to just withdraw from Chamber membership, but I plan 
to defer to Linda Robertson.  I am interested in your insights, or, if you 
prefer, you can simply refer them to Linda or me.",LAY-K

Here is the concept:

Today's Board of Directors are confronted by unprecedented complex issues
(globalization, optimizing board size for responsiveness, CEO
disintermediation, diversity, option repricing, CEO evaluation, board member

removal, increasing importance of audit committee, diverse shareholder time
horizons (for whom do we manage?)

These Board issues confront both large established companies as well as
emerging growth companies.  Spencer Stuart would like to host a provocative
examination of  issues common to Boards of today as a panel delves into some

of the issues common to boards at both ends of the spectrum.

Spencer Stuart is the market dominator in Board of Directors work.  Tom Neff

and Julie Daum, leaders of SpencerStuart's global board practice, will lead
a
lively discussion with our distinguished panel.

Defense Appropriation conference report which contains authority to 
permanently extend the exemption relating to OPIC and ExIm financing for 
projects in India is in the cue and could be affected by this action. 

Congressional authority for government operations expires this week as does 
the one-year exemption. Congress must act by Thursday to extend both items. 
Congress is expected to adopt a ""continuing resolution"" through October 29 
while the two branches of government work out their differences.

The President and Congressional leaders are to meet today to discuss and 
possibly establish a procedure for negotating the disagreement.",LAY-K

Subject: Dornbusch on Income Inequality and Pricing AIDS Medications to a  
Human Scale


Dear Dr. Lay:

New this week on www.TheGlobalist.com:

RUDI DORNBUSCH ON INCOME INEQUALITY
Poverty is bad -- but income inequality is not. MIT Professor Rudi
Dornbusch makes the argument that the development community
should not confuse inequality with poverty -- even though at the
bottom they might feel the same.

Coming Monday: A New Globalist Paper
PRICING AIDS MEDICATIONS TO A HUMAN SCALE
In a scramble for good publicity, pharmaceutical companies have
started a downward bidding war in pricing AIDS medications for
African markets. To add a much-needed measure of fairness to
the process, we propose a better alternative -- adjusting the price
of treatment to per-capita GDP.

Best regards from Washington,

Stephan Richter

2. The Environmental Propaganda Agency
3. William Lloyd Garrison, Antislavery Crusader

-------------------------------------------------------------

PENTAGON ""SHOCKED"" TO FIND RIVERS DAMMED WITH PORK

Captain Louis Renault -- Claude Raines's cheerfully duplicitous character in 
the 1942 film classic ""Casablanca"" -- asserted glibly that he was ""shocked, 
shocked"" to learn that gambling was taking place at Rick's Cafe. Moments 
later he was only too happy to collect his gambling earnings for the night.

All this is by way of preamble to a new Pentagon investigation of fraud in 
military construction. The investigation concluded that three senior Army 
Corps of Engineers officials had, just as one whistle-blowing Corps economist 
had claimed, engaged in a deceitful campaign to justify what the Washington 
Post called ""a billion-dollar construction binge on the Mississippi and 
Illinois rivers.""

""The [Pentagon] investigators concluded that the agency's aggressive efforts 
to expand its budget and missions, as well as its eagerness to please its 
corporate customers and congressional patrons, have helped 'create an 
atmosphere where objectivity in its analyses was placed in jeopardy,'"" the 
Post reports.

""Even the agency's retired chief economist told them that Corps studies were 
often 'corrupt,' and that several Corps employees cited 'immense pressure' to 
green-light questionable projects.""

Bureaucratic boondoggles of such magnitude are certainly newsworthy. But they 
are hardly news. Just as the Soviets derided the failures of previous Five 
Year Plans (only to implement new, equally flawed versions), so it seems that 
every few years the Pentagon uncovers massive corruption and waste in its own 
centrally planned fiefdom -- only to present a new Plan that operates under 
the same bad incentives that encouraged prior malfeasance.

With corruption and waste seemingly ""taken care of,"" the worst pork-barrel 
spenders in Congress and the military are then let off the hook, only to 
enjoy -- like Casablanca's Renault and Rick -- an amicable toast to the 
beginnings of a beautiful new friendship.

-------------------------------------------------------------

THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROPAGANDA AGENCY

Will the neck-to-neck presidential race help reduce -- or intensify -- 
pressure for the next president of the United States to score points with 
statist environmental activists?

Except on a few controversial issues, a strong case can be made that the 
forty-third President of the United States will wish to portray himself as a 
close friend of ""the environment."" President George W. Bush, for example, 
would face strong pressure to show that he is ""bipartisan"" in his approach to 
environmental protection; whereas President Al Gore would likely attempt to 
win back those who supported Nader and the Greens.

All the more reason, then, to call attention to the failures of the current 
approach to environmental protection -- especially those emanating from the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or, as economist Craig Marxsen terms 
it, the Environmental Propaganda Agency.

The EPA sometimes employs the language of cost-benefit analysis to illustrate 
its seemingly tremendous success, but it is known to employ it in a highly 
misleading manner. The EPA claimed, for example, that its Clean Air Act 
programs produced, from 1970 to 1990, $22.2 trillion dollars in health 
benefits at a cost of only $523 billion. But, reports Marxsen in THE 
INDEPENDENT REVIEW, ""[The EPA's] study actually represents a milestone in 
bureaucratic propaganda. Like junk science in the courtroom, the study 
seemingly attempts to obtain the largest possible benefit figure rather than 
to come as close as possible to the truth.""

In conclusion, writes Marxsen, ""Without the illusory benefit of all the lives 
saved, the actual benefits of the Clean Air Act were very modest and probably 
could have been achieved nearly as well with far less sacrifice. The Clean 
Air Act and its amendments force the EPA to mandate reduction of air 
pollution to levels that would have no adverse health effects on even the 
most sensitive person in the population. The EPA relentlessly presses forward 
in its absurd quest, like a madman setting fire to his house in an insane 
determination to eliminate the last of the insects infesting it.""

Marxsen (THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW, Summer 2000), at

WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON, Antislavery Crusader

""I will be as harsh as truth, and as uncompromising as justice. On this 
subject, I do not wish to think, or speak, or write with moderation.... I 
will not equivocate -- I will not excuse -- I will not retreat a single inch 
-- and I will be heard.""
     -- William Lloyd Garrison, THE LIBERATOR, January 1, 1831

December 12 marks the 195th anniversary of the birth of William Lloyd 
Garrison, a leading figure in the American abolitionist movement. As the late 
historian Henry Mayer explained in his National Book Award-Finalist 
biography, ALL ON FIRE: William Lloyd Garrison and the Abolition of Slavery:

""William Lloyd Garrison (1805-1879) is an authentic American hero who, with a 
Biblical prophet's power and a propagandist's skill, forced the nation to 
confront the most crucial moral issue in its history. For thirty-five years 
he edited and published a weekly newspaper in Boston, THE LIBERATOR, which 
remains today a sterling and unrivaled example of personal journalism in the 
service of civic idealism.

""Although Garrison -- a self-made man with a scanty formal education -- 
considered himself 'a New England mechanic' and lived outside the precincts 
of the American intelligentsia, he nonetheless did the hard intellectual work 
of challenging orthodoxy, questioning public policy, and offering a luminous 
vision of a society transformed. He inspired two generations of activists -- 
female and male, black and white -- and together they built a social movement 
which, like the civil rights movement of our own day, was a collaboration of 
ordinary people, stirred by injustice and committed to each other, who 
achieved a social change that conventional wisdom first condemned as wrong 
and then ridiculed as impossible.""

Indeed, without Garrison's inflammatory but compelling writing, speaking and 
organizing, there might have been no effective American anti-slavery movement 
at all.

For more on William Lloyd Garrison, read historian Henry Mayer's talk from 
the Independent Policy Forum, ""The Civil War: Liberty and American Leviathan"" 
(with Jeffrey Rogers Hummel), at

RealAudio at http://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-7.html.

             Eli Lilly and Company Launches Lillydiabetes.com
          New Web Site Designed To Help Patients Manage Diabetes

 Lillydiabetes.com is valuable resource for the 16 million Americans with
                                 diabetes


Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) has launched lillydiabetes.com (

http://www.lillydiabetes.com), an interactive Web site designed to help the

16 million Americans with diabetes and their families understand and manage

the disease and its complications.  The Web site provides patients

information about diabetes and gives them tools to help manage their

disease.



""Diabetes is a progressive, potentially debilitating disease that requires

regular monitoring of blood sugar, blood pressure and weight, among other

things,"" said Doug Rude, e-commerce team leader, Eli Lilly and Company.

""Lillydiabetes.com can help empower patients and their families with the

information and tools necessary to manage their disease and live healthier

lives.""



Lillydiabetes.com has a number of features and tools to encourage

aggressive management of diabetes.  Because diabetes is a chronic,

progressive disease, it is important that patients closely track their

progress toward better blood-sugar control, as well as the development of

diabetes-related complications. Those who register with the site have

access

to customizable ""Measures of Control"" tools designed to help patients

monitor their diabetes and the complications that can arise.  The Measures

of Control tools include:



?    HbA1c Chart (blood-sugar control) ? Hemoglobin A1c test measures
average blood-sugar levels over a two to three-month period.  Each time an
HbA1c test is done, patients can enter the value and save it as a color
graph, which then can be used to track the patient's progress toward better
blood-sugar control.
?    Height and Weight Index ? Excess body fat can lead to insulin
resistance, a major factor in the development of type 2 diabetes.  This
tool helps patients calculate their body mass index, which is a measure of
body weight relative to height.  The Web site then provides a place to save
that information and chart progress toward desired weight.


?    Blood Pressure Chart ? A common complication of diabetes is high blood
pressure, which can lead to heart disease as well as signal other
potentially serious problems, such as diabetic kidney disease.  This tool
allows patients to enter their blood pressure levels, save them and chart
their progress.


Other resources found on lillydiabetes.com include:



Product Information ? With more than 75 years of innovation in diabetes

care, Eli Lilly and Company has developed many products for the treatment

of diabetes.  This section informs users about treatment options and the

latest breakthroughs.



Lilly Diabetes Today?  Newsletter ? Users can request to receive by e-mail

Subject: Invitation for IAEE Keynote


Hi Rosalee-- I just wanted to thank you so much for your extra help on our
inquiry to Ken.  We understand completely that the April 25 slot following
his return from vacation is not the most ideal arrangement.  I think it's
always easiest for someone like him if he knows that a speech given recently
can easily serve as the basis for a new request.  I wanted to remind you of
my previous suggestion that his keynote presentation in Montreal last May to
the World Forum on Energy Regulation would accomplish most of that, and we
would work with Rob and others to minimize any effort required to add new
content.  Hopefully, this will help with the decision this week.  As I
mentioned the other day, Ken is really the most authoritative figure when it
comes to the idea that economic concepts can be used to build energy markets
and business enterprises that lead to better societies!  Talk soon, and
don't hesitate to ever ask for a ""quid pro quo"" from us.

      mation


To:  Bruce LaBoon, Steve Miller, Charles Duncan, Ken Lay, Steve
Letbetter, Dan Smith, Kelly Frels, Ed Galante, Jim Edmonds, Jim Kollaer

The purpose of this email is to provide additional detail to follow up on
the phone call each of you received on Friday, checking availability for
dinner with Congressman DeLay and others on Friday, April 6th.

BACKGROUND  During the last week of February, BCCA and Partnership leaders
met separately with Congressman DeLay, Congressman Joe Barton and with two
top staff members of Mr. DeLay, in order to update them on our extensive
activities aimed at federal Clean Air Act compliance.  Pursuant to those
meetings, Mr. DeLay's office has asked for some follow-up meetings to be
held in Houston on Friday, April 6th.   He intends to travel to this area
on
that day along with, and as host to, Congressman Barton (R-Texas, Chairman
of the Energy and Power Subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and
Commerce) and with Congressman Billy Tauzin (R-Louisiana, Chairman, House
Committee on Energy and Commerce).    The Energy and Commerce Committee has
oversight over Clean Air Act matters.  DeLay has requested support from and
interaction with the BCCA and the Partnership on that day.

APRIL 6TH ACTIVITY  After time spent early in the day in Mr. DeLay's
congressional district to meet with Brazoria and Fort Bend County local
officials, Mr. DeLay has asked us to then pick up the itinerary with a ship
channel tour and presentations on SIP status, science and modeling issues.
We are working closely with Mr. DeLay's staff on all these matters.

He has asked to end the day with a ""small dinner with CEOs"" to have a frank
discussion about our clean air issues.  This is the dinner my staff called
your office about on Friday.  Clearly, Mr. DeLay is interested in what he
and the other congressmen may be able to due legislatively to assist in
addressing some of the issues we have with the SIP.   He has asked that we
also invite Governor Perry to attend the dinner, which we are doing.  Mr.
DeLay will call the Governor to encourage his attendance.  This will
obviously be a critical opportunity to relay targeted information and
advise
on strategy with key members of Congress and the Governor.  Everyone in
attendance at the dinner will be provided coordinated talking points in
advance.  There may also be a formal briefing arranged immediately before
or
after the April 3 Partnership Board meeting so we can prep in advance.

RSVPs TO DATE  Responses so far indicate that Steve Miller, Ed Galante, Jim
Edmonds and Jim Kollaer are confirmed to attend the dinner.  Charles Duncan
and Kelly Frels are checking calendars.  Ken Lay, Steve Letbetter and Dan
Smith are unavailable.  We do not have a commitment yet from the Governor.
We will likely recruit two or three other CEOs from BCCA member companies
to
attend the dinner.

My current thought is to house the members of Congress at the St. Regis and
to arrange the dinner either at the River Oaks Country Club or possibly at
a
board member's home nearby.

I trust this additional information is useful to you.  I will be the
Partnership point person on this -- please do not hesitate to call me with
any questions you may have.  Thank you.

Dear Rosalee,

The Council meeting in Geneva will take place on 31 August-1 September. As
is a tradition, it will start with a dinner on Thursday 31 August and end
on Friday 1 September at around 3 pm, so that the Council members can still
return home for the weekend.
A detailed agenda and further information will be sent out in the next

I hope that this preliminary information will be of help to you. If you
have any specific questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Hey there,

I just called your dad and congratulated the ""father of the bride""  He was 
VERY cute and walked me through his conversation with JL and his thoughts on 
Florida...FUN FUN FUN - He is so proud of you and thinks so highly of JL - I 
can hardly wait to meet him.

All my love,
Christina

YIPPEE - what fun...I have one more Florida suggestion - The Boca Beach Club. 
 Here is the pitch.

*    2 easy airport to fly into: Miami and West Palm
*    The BBC compound has 4 hotels and at least five restaurants - with
an amazing tower restaurant - which would we great for a rehearsal dinner
*    The four hotels include:  Condos, tower hotel, old estate rooms, and
beach front rooms.  There is a water shuttle and complementary shuttle - that 
is very convenient to transport people around!
*    Beautiful Ball room
*    2 Golf courses
*    Tons of tennis courts
*    Multiple Pools
*    Gorgeous entrance way


We have stayed there at least ten times and always have a great time.  Just a 
thought!

IRWIN M. STELZER
The Sunday Times
10 December 2000
    Buried deep in an issue of last week's Wall Street Journal is an
interview with venture capitalist Bill Davidow. As the crash in the value of
internet companies sours investors, and fills the financial pages with tales
of impending doom, Mr. Davidow has taken to reminding all who will listen,
""There was a tulip business even after the tulip mania."" Which prompted me to
dig out my copy of Mike Dash's Tulipomania -- subtitled, ""The Story of the
World's Most Coveted Flower & The Extraordinary Passions It Aroused.""
    Davidow is indeed right, and in the post-bubble history of the tulip
business may lurk some clues as to the history of the dot.coms, many of which
have been liquidated, while others have seen their values fall by as much as
90%.
    After the bubble burst, the trade in bulbs did not disappear. Prices
fell, but in a few years ""the trade regain[ed] some sort of equilibrium. The
speculators had gone, but there was still a market for the flower."" But at
far lower prices, with the specialty bulbs doing better than the garden
variety tulip. And it is not to stretch the analogy between tulip-growing and
the dot.com business to cite Dash's observation that ""most of the new and
inexperienced growers who had been attracted by the prospect of rich profits
gave up the business or were driven out.""
    Eventually, bulb growers learned how to turn a profit again. They
converted their business from a seasonal one to one that could produce all
year 'round -- something e-tailers have still to learn. They learned how to
destroy the viruses that periodically destroyed their businesses -- something
Microsoft et al. have still to learn. They learned how to compete with other
varieties of flower -- just as e-tailers have been learning how to click with
bricks-and-mortar retailers.
    In short, although the past is not necessarily prologue, history suggests
that there indeed life after a bubble bursts. For one thing, investors have
short memories: the tulipomania was followed by a spurt in the prices of
hyacinths in the eighteenth century, and by one in dahlias in 1838. Indeed,
as recently as 1985 prices of the red spider lily soared in China, reaching
$50,000 for the most coveted varieties, ""an amount that puts even the sums
paid at the height of the Dutch tulip craze to shame"", according to Dash.
    More important, the bursting of a bubble separates the wheat from the
chaff. The fact that the business graveyard is overflowing with the corpses
of dot.coms tells us less about the future role of the internet in our
economic lives than it does about the propensity of some to irrational
exuberance. It should come as no surprise that companies that not only failed
to earn any money as their customer lists swelled, but touted their mounting
losses as proof of their success in growing their businesses, should
eventually fall from investor favour.
    Nor should it be surprising that inexperienced entrepreneurs, whose sole
lasting contribution to American life has been the destruction of the
business suit, have discovered that there is more to running a successful
business than attracting the adulation of equally young and casually clad
reporters for trade magazines.
    Finally, it should not surprise us that the accumulation of data in this
era of the so-called ""new economy"" has led to a more sober appraisal of the
contribution of new technologies to the ability of the American economy to
grow without triggering significant inflation. We now know that the massive
investment in new technologies has increased the rate of growth in
productivity, and that the economy's speed limit has been raised to something
closer to 4% than to its old limit of about half that. That's not as
revolutionary as some of the more strident ""new economy"" advocates have been
claiming, but it is enough to make an unemployment rate of only 4%
sustainable in the long run without setting off a round of wage-price
inflation.
    What we have, then, is what might be called the residue of the dot.com
collapse -- a new way of doing business, greater productivity in important
sectors of the economy, lower transactions costs as buyers and sellers come
together without the intervention of middlemen, new exchanges in which
everything from electricity to broadband capacity can be traded efficiently,
and an increase in consumer power to resist price increases.
    These are permanent changes. The pace at which they are introduced and
become entrenched will, of course, be affected by the increased volatility of
share prices. Such volatility, after all, makes investment in shares somewhat
riskier, which is another way of saying that the price that entrepreneurs
will have to pay for capital to reward investors for taking these higher
risks will rise -- indeed, has already risen. But the improvements in
productivity and efficiency will not be reversed, even if the economy slows
significantly, as it now is deemed likely to do.
    Perhaps most important of all of our new knowledge is our increased
understanding of the use of the policy tools available to cope with economic
downturns. The market soared last week after Federal Reserve chairman Alan
Greenspan suggested that he was considering lowering interest rates, and the
Florida courts increased the likelihood that George W. Bush rather than the
more antibusiness Al Gore would move into the White House when the lease of
Bill and Hillary Clinton expires next month.
    Investors know that Greenspan can stimulate the economy by lowering
interest rates, which are high in real terms. After all, as discussed
elsewhere in these pages, he reversed a far more serious stock market plunge
in 1997 by easing monetary policy. Investors know, too, that the Bush team
aims to ease fiscal policy by pushing a tax cut through congress. That
combination of looser monetary and fiscal policies can go a long way towards
preventing this slowdown from becoming a recession.

Ken and Jeff,

As I think you both know I have been active in recruiting at Cornell for the 
Enron Associate program for several years now.  I also recently have become 
involved with something called the Park Leadership Fellowship Board which 
provides scholarships and forums to discuss business leadership issues.  They 
are holding a pretty prominent event called Leadership week which will 
include the business heads of Corning and American Express discussing their 
company's strategies for defining leadership in business today.  I hate to 
ask you guys to do things like this but it is a pretty big event and would 
really highlight Enron's recognition of Cornell as being a ""Core School"" in 
the MBA recruiting process.  The event as outlined below is scheduled for 
March 28th.  I appreciate your consideration.

Kevin

Kevin-


Just a quick follow-up on my November 2 email regarding Enron's
participation in the Johnson School's March Leadership Week and the
possibility of doing a case study on Enron.  Wondered if you have had a
chance to float these ideas with Jeff or Ken?  I know you have lots on
you plate.  Let me know if you have any sense of how this might go. 
Below is the earlier email I sent to you.  Thanks for the help.  Hope all
is well with you.


            Nov.2 email text


We at Cornell's Johnson School would like to establish a stronger link
with Enron, a company which we believe to be a leading example of the
agile organization which will dominate in the dynamic, unpredictable
markets of the next decade.  One connecting point which we would like
Enron to consider is with our Center for Leadership in Dynamic
Organizations which draws faculty and students from across Cornell and
beyond.


The specific activities that we propose at this point in time are two. 
First, we would like to invite a senior leader from Enron to be a key
speaker at the Johnson School's Leadership Week in March, 2001.  As
described in the attached materials, Leadership Week is made up of three
conferences focused on academic faculty, leading-edge corporations and
students.  We very much would like Enron to present what we call a ""live
case study"" at the corporate conference on <underline>March 28,
2001</underline>.


You, of course, are an obvious candidate to do this.  Alternatively, this
is the kind of event that is made to order for Jeff Skilling or Ken Lay
and would give them a chance to interact with other corporate leaders and
the Cornell community.  Other corporate leaders we have signed up for the
corporate conference are John Loose, President and COO of Corning, Ken
Chenault, incoming CEO of American Express, Marty Coyne, just announced
President of Kodak's new Commercial Group.  Each of these leaders has a
distinct message to deliver about the leadership challenges involved in
continually reinventing themselves in a fast-changing marketplace.  


We have several other speakers lined up for other parts of Leadership
Week, including Ken Blanchard and, we think, Abbey Cohen from Goldman
Sachs.  We have some chance of getting Bill Ford from Ford Motor Company
and an outside shot at Jack Welch through our President Emeritus Frank
Rhodes, but these are still long shots.


The point is that this is the biggest thing that will happen at the
Johnson School and probably at Cornell next year.  If Jeff or Ken wanted
a platform for telling the Enron story, this would be a good one.  If
they can't do it, hopefully we could convince you to do it.  Again, the
date is March 28, 2001.       


The second proposal is to develop a teaching case on Enron along the same
lines.  In fact, if we started working on the teaching case soon, it
could become the basis for the March conference live case study
presentation.  We believe that Enron is unique in its ability to
literally create new markets.  The question is how do you lead and manage
an organization to keep the tight financial and risk controls in place
that you do, but still create the entrepreneurial behavior that seems to
be the case at Enron.  What kind of management philosophies, systems and
practices make this possible.


I know that Enron was the subject of two Harvard cases in 1993 and around
1997.  As I understand it neither focused on organizational and
leadership issues.  We would like to devote a small research team to
building this case about Enron, directed by myself and Professor Lee Dyer
from the ILR School.  We would need access to a number of people in the
Enron organization, but are very aware of the demands on time for fast
moving organizations and are committed to doing this in a very efficient
way.


Kevin, we appreciate your willingness to entertain these two ideas and
hopefully test them with your top leaders.  We will do anything we can to
make it feasible for Enron to engage with us on these two initiatives. 
Please let me know what I can do to help you carry this forward.  As
always, thanks for your great personal support.


Dick

Video on the Move
Dropping costs and rising competition are forcing operators to see
video-on-demand in a whole new light
BY SIMON APPLEBAUM
At VOD programmer Diva, the deployment forecast gets more specific, as does
the rationale behind why operators will push the action. Three factors come
into play:
* DBS penetration continues to fly and bite off operators' best customers;
* the plunging expense of video-server hardware and video-stream
transmissions, which make moot the big, prohibitive load operators have used
to justify not deploying VOD;
* the fallout from Time Warner's deal to merge with America Online --
namely, considerable encouragement to accelerate plans in every other
convergence direction they want to travel, be it digital cable services
(including near-VOD and tiers), high-speed Web surfing through cable modems,
or interactive TV.
Thus with cost and infrastructure concerns put aside, and competition
staring them in the face, operators see VOD in a new light. Now that DBS
reaches 13 million subs ""and is heading for 20 million, cable is feeling the
pain,"" says Diva president David Zucker. ""Every one of the eight largest
cable operators, every single one, will deploy or trial VOD in some manner.
The big rollouts will start the second half of the year."" If they come, they
may hear another set of competitive footsteps entering the scene. Digital
subscriber line carriers such as SBC and Qwest, hunting for high-speed
Internet households, are poised to reach out and become must-see VOD TV
through Viacom subsidiary Blockbuster. With infrastructure help from Enron
Broadband Services, Blockbuster will deploy a movies-driven VOD service in a
number of cities by December, and all over the U.S. next year. The joint
venture will go after cable and DBS distribution, but off the bat, DSL will
be in the driver's seat, as routed through SBC, Qwest and other suppliers.
But right now, reality is nowhere near the perception Jacobsen and Zucker
suggest. Few multi-system owners have VOD formats fully deployed or in
trial; most MSOs don't, even though they are deep in digital-service
launches incorporating near-VOD, which takes up 30 channels or more of a
system's lineup. Video-on-demand, on the other hand, uses far fewer channels
than NVOD, because video servers, placed at or near the system's headend,
store the programming and transmit it on addressable command from
subscribers, any time, over streaming transmissions. How high is the payoff
for mass cable adoption? Try 40 to 60 percent, by 2010, of the multi-billion
dollar revenue pot home-video companies enjoy now, predicted Merrill Lynch
senior media analyst Jessica Reif-Cohen at the recent Myers interactive-TV
forum in New York.
Where the Action Is
You need more than one hand to count the number of VOD projects happening
around the country, but you don't need many more. Here's the scorecard:
 * Diva - VOD's veteran packager is doing full-deployment business in at
least 10 areas. Affiliates include AT&T Broadband in Marin County, Calif.
(outside San Francisco) and Atlanta (formerly MediaOne turf); Charter
Communications in the Atlanta suburbs; and a growing number of Insight
Communications locales (Columbus, Ohio; Rockford, Ill.; and Evansville,
Ind.) where VOD is bundled with Source Media's Local Source interactive-TV
service. Before Labor Day, Charter will add Diva to at least one of its Los
Angeles-area systems. More than 400 titles, from movie blockbusters to
special-interest videos, are available each month. Top films go for $3.95 a
pop, while classic flicks and other titles get priced at $2.95 or below.
Available attractions include library shows from ESPN, TNT, Discovery and
other cable nets. About 15,000 subs use the service at least once a month.
 * Time Warner - Cable's second-largest operator is in full VOD blast,
following a trial run in Austin, Texas, last summer. Honolulu became the
first Time Warner locale to make VOD available system-wide earlier this
year, covering about 250,000 subs. Tampa, Fla., turned on in June, according
to Concurrent Computer, which provides servers and streaming tech to Time
Warner. About 100,000 Tampa-area subs are getting their day in the VOD sun.
* Intertainer - After two years of development and tests, the VOD player
that includes Microsoft, Comcast, NBC, Sony and Intel among its equity
stakeholders will soon premiere in Comcast's suburban Baltimore system. That
follows DSL rollouts in U S West's Denver enterprise and Cincinnati under an
independent franchiser. The service has plenty of interactive features to
accompany the content, including opportunities to order an artist's CD after
watching his music video; local information retrieval; and e-commerce
choices. Intertainer CEO Jonathan Taplin promises a ""stunning""
MSO-affiliation announcement over the next few weeks.
* In Demand - PPV's kingpin player was already talking to affiliates about
VOD rollouts and trials when new president Stephen Brenner assumed his post
earlier this summer (see sidebar, p. 30).
* TVN - In Demand's closest PPV/NVOD rival, whose affiliate base consists of
mid-size and small system owners, is in the midst of several VOD technical
and marketing trials. Some rollout announcements are expected early this
fall. Like Diva and Intertainer, TVN wants to combine programming with
interactive applications.
 * DemandVideo - This California-based firm surfaced this spring, initially
on a quest for cable overbuilder affiliates so that they wouldn't be absent
from VOD activity. Seren Innovations (which runs its systems under Astound
Cable TV) and Knology signed up before the National Cable TV Association
convention, and Seren put Demand's format through a 25-home trial in St.
Cloud, Minn. But at NCTA's show in May, Demand CEO Rajiv Juluria insisted
that his product will be available to all comers, entrenched or encroacher.
Knology will launch the service among hotels in Panama City, Fla., while
Seren commits to a full St. Cloud rollout, plus deployment in Contra Costa
County, Calif.
* E-Video TV - A new VOD player out of Scottsdale, Ariz., E-Video has
developed download technology through which digital cable subs can retrieve
feature films, programming and interactive games. Roy Bennett, E-Video's
president, says his firm will try the process out with a cable operator
before summer ends.
Up ahead in the player pipeline: StreamBox and AlwaysonTV.com, two ventures
running both video and Internet content. Both exhibited two months ago at
Streaming Media East in New York. Within VOD's own tech vendordom --
companies that provide video servers and program-insertion gear to operators
-- there's growing consensus that the on-demand era launches this fall. How
fast VOD takes off is more in the hands of set-top box providers than MSOs,
believes Concurrent CEO Steve Nussrallah. The sooner they flood the scene
with digital converters, the sooner deployments happen.  ""We're at the front
door of an explosion. Late fall or early next year is the right time for
this market to happen,"" he says. ""The only thing holding the market back is
the ability of set-top vendors to build and ship their product at a level
equal to the demand. By the end of 2004, we should be north of 30 million
digital set-tops, with the vast majority of them VOD-enabled. Deployment by
operators becomes a no-brainer."" AOL Time Warner will push operators into
deployment decisions, adds nCube president Michael Pohl. ""The convergence of
Time Warner's content with the broadband opportunities AOL looks at will
drive the content and availability of content for VOD,"" Pohl suggests.
""Movies are OK and great, probably a good place to start, but ultimately,
viewers want to go to their operator and ask for whatever they want to see.""
""You see the operators showing excitement for VOD now, as opposed to the
vendors showing excitement, which is what it was for the last few years,""
says Yvette Gordon, interactive technologies VP at SeaChange Technologies.
""The AOL-Time Warner merger helps.""
The Naysayers
But many people don't buy it. Take Playboy Television -- they're supplying
product to selected Diva and Time Warner VOD markets. They're in the game,
but Playboy TV president Jim English doesn't look for a breakout market
until 2002. Why? Despite big declines in server cost, ""you need so many per
state, so many per [sub universe],"" English reasons. ""The more subs on the
line, the slower the traffic goes. It's still very expensive electronics.
I'm not trying to poke holes at anyone, but a lot of projections about this
industry didn't come out as advertised. How many years did it take for
digital cable to move? Even now, operators have more trucks dedicated to
installing high-speed cable modems than digital cable. And on cable's agenda
priority scale, just getting the digital box in is number one."" For
Susquehanna Communications and Classic Cable, 2001 is the year VOD will make
it to their systems, provided the tech issues English raises get resolved.
As big as the case is for getting economics down enough for deployment among
large MSOs, it's magnified several times over for owners the size of
Susquehanna and Classic.  ""Insight, for example, can serve tens or hundreds
of thousands of customers from a single headend. The best we can do is 7,000
customers from a single headend. For the small, non-metro markets we
service, how do you amortize the cost for initial equipment installation?""
asks Classic CEO Merritt Belisle. ""When you take into account the
flexibility and long-term viability of the tech, and different content
avenues, there's a lot that's nascent and in development,"" responds Dan
Templain, Susquehanna's corporate marketing/programming director. ""The
content and the tech have to become compelling enough to consumers that
we're willing to roll it out."" Still, Templain's company is determined to do
a field trial somewhere this fall, and get deployment underway before the
end of next March. ""That's accelerated thinking from where we were six
months ago."" To SVOD or Not to SVOD? On the programming side, the train
everyone wants to be aboard is making VOD a diverse medium, perhaps to the
point where the medium should be relabeled ""COD"" -- for content-on-demand.
Movies, available at or earlier than home-video release, lead the way, but
not far behind are sports, live/taped events from all over, how-to and
special-interest videos, children's fare, games, adult entertainment and a
few genres spun out of the imagination of others.  ""There may be
localized-content opportunities,"" chirps In Demand's Jacobsen. ""Local
theater, high school football games with real community value."" In a COD
world, ""you're not limited to video product,"" says TVN senior business
development VP Jim Riley. ""Eventually, you download computer software so you
can view it on your TV as well as on your PC. That's where we're driving
some of our development energies."" TVN's vehicle is Chromazone, involving
California-based venture capitalist Digital Evolution. From the start,
Intertainer has embraced a link of COD with interactive elements. ""If MSOs
make the investment in VOD, they must maximize it with advertising,
e-commerce and all sorts of interactivity,"" says Jonathan Taplan,
Intertainer's president and CEO. ""That's the ultimate promise. If you think
about the capital investment and the possible return in gross revenues, like
$20 a sub per month, that's a damn good business."" Diva, infused with $9
million earlier this summer from operating system/middleware players OpenTV
and Liberate Technologies (CV, 7/17/00, p. 98), now has economic backing to
pursue its own interactive-integration course. And soon, cable operators
will see if their VOD future should incorporate subscription
video-on-demand, or SVOD. Encore Media Group, under CEO John Sie, is betting
a substantial chunk of its future on it, and in a matter of weeks, AT&T
Broadband's newly acquired Atlanta system (off the completed MediaOne
merger) will test SVOD out using Encore, Starz! and Encore's multiplex
movies. Here's the SVOD deal, as Sie explains it: Premium service subs, for
an extra fee, get 20-30 titles running on that service that month on-demand,
with VCR functionality. The subs watch those films whenever they want, as
many times as they want, for that one fee. Six or eight dollars a month will
do. ""We're using VOD as a viewer enhancement platform,"" Sie insists. ""Movies
will drive things first. Once they drive penetration, you can do
subscription news-on-demand and other things on-demand."" Lately, Sie's SVOD
advocacy comes framed inside a clarion call to move operators in the
direction of all-digital system conversion. Direct broadcast satellite
services are that way now, and Sie believes cable system owners have two
years at most to make that transition, contrary to the seven-to-10-year
timeframe other industry execs predict. ""You know and I know consumer demand
for digital far exceeds set-top box availability, as well as the supply of
installation crews. DBS realized that and now they're ramping up,"" Sie
believes. But opponents find two flaws in SVOD: Because the product is
available in the premium window, six months or more after PPV availability,
there may not be as much audience demand for it compared to pre-PPV.
Independent of audience demand, there's the specter of cannibalization,
where on-demand use comes at the expense of premium-channel viewing. ""Here's
a way to enhance and optimize premium services,"" Nussrallah concludes. ""If
you get constant access to the programming, it's more customer-friendly, and
something DBS can't provide. Cable is built on the concept that the audience
buys more if they have more choice and convenience. It may be the next
opportunity window."" Not so, Taplin figures. ""It would be cool to get all of
The Sopranos on a VOD package. But why would people who already see movies
on premium pay for more of those same movies, after they've had the chance
to watch those movies in an on-demand way. Unless Sie prices it so low, or
unless they like those movies a lot, why would they pay again? The flat-fee
model is a great model, like cellular-phone pricing. People love paying one
fee for unlimited monthly use. But the window isn't the right window."" Sie
defends SVOD as an enhancement option. ""Would an operator launch digital
cable with pay TV only and not launch PPV, concluding that PPV cannibalizes
pay, or vice versa? No, because they complement each other beautifully. Same
here."" Other VOD programmers and tech vendors will pursue SVOD experiments.
TVN is investigating one or more affiliate partnerships for a test. Classic
and Susquehanna are open to proposals. ""What John says is super. What does
it cost me? I've got a stock market and bond market to work with,"" Belisle
says.
Stream Thinking
Susquehanna exec Templain calls SVOD ""a work in progress platform."" Others
say the same about streamed video content, another pot worthy of industry
exploitation. ""Spectacular"" may be the most accurate adjective for the
assortment of video Internet sites have streamed to PC households
everywhere, from quirky animation to short films to news clips. More
diverse, longer streamed content is coming down the pike. Will the very same
tech making mass VOD deployment possible now also make possible a new
original content pipe? What an ironic circumstance. Check in with the sites
themselves, from Real Networks on down, and the masterminds behind them
point to TV and cable display as their final destination. Fifty million PCs,
more than 100 million TV homes, almost 70 percent of them cabled -- the
market's obvious to them. In the end, that's the ticket, cable execs concur.
But for the near term, no. The broadcast quality's not there yet (although
tech strides are happening), and there's considerable fear that producers
will use streaming to bypass cable nets. Gordon targets mid to late 2001 as
the point where streamed content will be TV/VOD-suitable. Assuming the
industry locks its fears away, nCube's Pohl sides with the crowd awaiting
""this kind of ubiquitous media, where things go to the TV or PC."" ""We're
sleeping fine at night about this, because the quality is not there yet,""
adds Diva's Zucker. ""But we will make video streaming a Holy Grail for TV in
the next few years, and cable will be uniquely positioned to take advantage
of it."" *

I just completed watching the Enron All Employee Meeting you hosted in 
Houston on my PC in my office. What a fantastic way to conduct a meeting. I 
was able to listen while I worked, stopping only when a particular subject 
aroused my attention. And being able to see the slide presentation at the 
same time was so much better than  trying to read that little type from a 
long distance over a sea of heads that keep bobbing. 

The only problem I experienced was a cutting out of the audio signal. Once a 
situation like this is resolved I believe Enron may have found the ideal 
solution to communicate to all their employees in a less costly and time 
consuming method than the standard meeting.

I heard from Wade that there were a number of questions on Dabhol yesterday 
and I thought it may help if u received a quick update. Over the last 3 days, 
I have met with most key players in GOI and GOM assisted by some very close 
friends of ours. The start of the state assembly session has given some 
politicians and some vested interests an opportunity to raise issues about 
Dabhol in the assembly again, a feature that we have seen every year, at 
about this time, without exception and has led to a number of misleading 
newspaper reports. The usual suspects are behind the latest stirring of the 
pot. 

The facts however are as follows:

1. GOM (at the administrative and political level) and MSEB remain firmly 
behind the project and the commitments to it. They are concerned but at the 
same time looking at proactively working to find a solution. They also 
believe that they may have found one that is agreeable to GOI.

2. After discussions with us on Tuesday, GOM and MSEB are working on a plan  
(thru this weekend) to treat Dabhol as a national asset. The plan involves 
MSEB selling  power from DPC to the central government utility which will 
then pool the power with over 30,000 MW of power that they currently  control 
and sell the power onward to other states. The plan has already been 
discussed at senior levels in the GOI and finds general acceptance. Obviously 
the details are to be worked out and we are proceeding to help GOM put the 
outline together over this weekend in Delhi and GOM will then discuss it with 
MOP on Monday. 

Wade reported that it was felt that the seniormost GOI ministers be apprised  
of the seriousness which with we are viewing this situation. This was already 
done Tuesday.

3. The Indian Lenders to the Dabhol project have met and agreed to a 30 day 
waiver of MSEB delay in payment - agreed subject to review of the situation 
at the end of 6 months. They have also agreed to the Equity transfer - 
subject to lenders counsel confirming that there are no legal issues under 
any of the project contracts. This shows the lender support for continuing to 
move forward and buys us time to put in place the fix we are planning.

4. Ministry of Power has yesterday agreed to support an effort to freeze the 
duties on imported fuel at a lower level of about $12/bbl versus the current 
$35 or so. This will help achieve an immediate reduction in tariff from Phase 
I and make Dabhol more competitive. This proposal is currently with Ministry 
of Finance and our expectation is that they will review it favorably as the 
MOP is taking it up personally.

All signs that I have received in India over the last few days lead me to 
believe that the GOM is committed to solving the Dabhol issues at the 
earliest. While we all have concerns, they seem to be addressable and if the 
current plan is successful, they can  be sorted out within the context of 
current and existing documentation.

I have left names out but they are better discussed on the call that has been 
scheduled for Monday evening India time. Hope that this helps in the meantime.

Mexico Meeting 2000
Managing New Expectations and Old Challenges
Mexico City, Mexico 4-5 December

Dear Dr Lay,

Mexico awoke to a new political landscape on 2 July 2000. The economic and 
business climate is positive and full of new opportunities as Mexico finally 
completes a long transition from one-party dominance to pluralist democracy, 
adding political maturity to a more competitive market economy.

In light of the above, the World Economic Forum will hold a Mexico Meeting 
2000 on 4-5 December in Mexico City. Held in collaboration with the Mexican 
Investment Board, this gathering will take place three days after the 
inauguration of the new Mexican administration. We have already received 
confirmation that President-elect Vicente Fox and Mexican Central Bank 
Governor Guillermo Ortiz will participate. We are also expecting the presence 
of the future key cabinet members and state governors.

As usual, the World Economic Forum pulls together the right group of leaders 
to discuss issues, build a network of contacts and identify where future 
business opportunities and risks lie. The Meeting will focus on four main 
topics: the country's political and social agenda, Mexico's commercial 
relationships with the rest of the world, the new economy and the key issues 
for the country's main industries.

Please consult our website, http://www.weforum.org/mexico, where information 
will be updated as soon as it becomes available.

IN THIS WEEK'S ISSUE:
1. Holding Bureaucrats Personally Accountable: A 1st Amendment Victory
2. The Independent Review: Fall Issue Now Available
3. Public Health vs. The Nanny State? -- Next Independent Policy
Forum (10/26/00)

-------------------------------------------------------------

HOLDING BUREAUCRATS PERSONALLY ACCOUNTABLE: A 1st Amendment Victory

The legal doctrine of ""sovereign immunity"" -- and its modern cousin,
""qualified immunity"" -- has historically allowed government
bureaucrats to escape full accountability for misdeeds they have
perpetrated under the guise of government ""policy."" Thus, a recent
decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals -- ruling that a group
of government bureaucrats may be held personally liable for
outrageous constitutional violations -- is news worthy of celebration.

The facts of the case attest to the need for strong checks on
government power. Three Berkeley, Calif., residents had campaigned
against a proposed homeless shelter in their neighborhood. At the
behest of local ""housing rights"" activists, who said the anti-shelter
campaign was discriminatory and violated the Fair Housing Act, the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) got into the
act. HUD officials demanded interviews with the three anti-shelter
neighbors, told their neighbors they had violated the law, and
ordered them to give HUD all materials -- including the names,
addresses and phone numbers of other opponents of the shelter -- that
they had collected for their campaign. To the ""Berkeley Three,"" HUD's
harassment violated their freedom of speech. To the appeals court,
""qualified immunity"" of government bureaucrats did not apply here;
the Berkeley Three may proceed with their First Amendment lawsuit
against the HUD officials and seek monetary damages.

This ruling, although unusual by today's standards, harks back to
another early legal tradition: the idea that citizens can hold
government officials personally liable for improper conduct. In 1763,
John Wilkes, a member of Britain's parliament, was the subject of an
outrageous search and seizure warrant issued by Secretary of State
Lord Halifax, after Wilkes published an anonymous attack on the
government. Wilkes then sued Halifax and other officials and was
awarded a sum comparable to $20 million today. Americans were so
enraptured with this refutation of unrestrained government power that
they made Wilkes a hero and followed in his footsteps, suing
government officials for unreasonable search and seizures.

Since the 19th century, however, this common-law tradition has nearly
withered away. The creation of the exclusionary rule has replaced
Wilkes's remedy with an inferior one. While the exclusionary rule
brings some satisfaction to criminals who are the subject of
unreasonable searches and seizures, it does nothing for the innocent.
Furthermore, the 20th century has seen the rise of the doctrine of
""qualified immunity,"" which the U.S. Supreme Court explains ""seeks to
ensure that [government] defendants 'reasonably can anticipate when
their conduct may give rise to liability,' by attaching liability
only if '[t]he contours of the right [violated are] sufficiently
clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is
doing violates that right.'""

The Ninth Circuit's recent ruling that HUD officials were not acting
reasonably when they violated the First Amendment rights of the
Berkeley Three is refreshing because it rekindles the idea that civil
liability can be a restraint on government power. In an era when
bureaucratic violations of the rule of law have become routine, it is
an idea long overdue.

THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW: Fall Issue Now Available

* Why did urban rioters of the 1960s target small businesses -- and
why have so many commentators rationalized the mob violence?
* Are some school-choice proposals more promising than others?
* Have economists been too quiet on Medicare reform?
* Is taxation morally defensible?
* How did racism affect employment on the early railroads?
* Why do government bureaucracies in general, and public education in
particular, produce such deplorable outcomes?
* Why did Reaganomics turn out as it did?

These topics and more are discussed in the Fall 2000 issue of THE
INDEPENDENT REVIEW: A Journal of Political Economy, the Independent
Institute's 160-page quarterly. Contributors to the fall issue

PUBLIC HEALTH vs. THE NANNY STATE? -- Next Independent Policy Forum (10/26/00)

Barely a day goes by without some news of the latest public health
""threat."" Serious health hazards, we are told, lurk around every
corner -- in water supplies, air, soil, beverages, fast food,
second-hand smoke, cellular phones, and food irradiation, just to
name a handful. And yet, Americans today live longer than ever! Are
markets and private decision-making providing the answers? Or are
these dangers real, immediate, and a legitimate mandate for
government control? Can we reduce or eliminate health risks without
government dictates? How does politics distort perceptions about
public health? Will Americans succumb to or rebel against the growing
Nanny State's neo-Puritanism and attack on individual choice and
responsibility? JACOB SULLUM and THOMAS DiLORENZO will discuss these
timely and important issues.

SPEAKERS:

      - Jacob Sullum (Senior Editor, Reason magazine; Author, FOR YOUR

During the negotiations with the Rockets as to how much each party would
contribute to the Arena referendum campaign, Mike Goldberg of Baker & Botts
suggested that the Rockets would like to net their contribution obligation
against other contributions that they solicited.

After a conversation with you, John Watson and I advised Mike Goldberg that
you did not want to be competing with the Rockets in soliciting
contributions to the Arena referendum campaign.

Mike Goldberg called Friday and asked whether it would be acceptable for the
Rockets to net against their contribution obligation contributions that they
have solicited from Baker & Botts, Jim MacInvale and Tilman Fertitta.  Mike
suggested that these three persons would be the only outside persons that
would be solicited by the Rockets.

To: Kenneth Lay/Corp/Enron@ENRON

Subject: EGM - all company meeting

Ken,

Per my voicemail, we are having an all employee meeting on next Monday at the 
Hyatt Regency.  The purpose of this meeting is to pull everyone together for 
an update on EGM and a brief presentation from all the business units within 
EGM.  This includes about 1 hour of business and then drinks and food - we 
expect about 500 people.  

We have made a lot of progress on changing the nature and profitability of 
these businesses and we want to make sure everyone sees just how far we have 
come in a few months.  

I believe they will be motivated to see the growth and profitability.  We had 
a record Q1 with $100 million of gross margin.  That was 50% of what they 
made in all of 2000.  Combined with the fact that in December of 2000 alone 
we made $87 million in gross margin, I believe it will have a big impact.

If you could attend the meeting even for a few minutes it would go a long way 
in helping us drive our other point which is that the EGM businesses are now 
core to Enron and has the attention of both you and Jeff.

Thanks for considering this and let me know if you need any other information 
or assistance.

Mike

Dear Ken:

Night before last I visited with President and Mrs. Bush and suggested that he
give you a call regarding TFA (Technology For All)! I told him that it might
prove valuable for his son's campaign!  When we spoke with Cynthia Sandherr in
Washington a week or so ago, she said that the ""Digital Divide"" was the 
hottest
topic on Capital Hill.  She had some wonderful ideas on how to spin this so 
that
businesses create the bridge for the divide and not government!  Although we
want to stay nonpartisan with TFA, this would be a wonderful press opportunity
and platform in Washington!

Just thought I should give you ""heads-up"" in case he asks and please tell 
Linda
I said hello!

Thank you for doing so much for the cause!

As reported Carlos Chacho Alvarez resigned his position Friday as Vice=20

The main reason of this resignation was a political disagreement with Cabin=
et=20
changes announced on Thursday 5th by President De la Rua.  Alvarez
publicly noted he could no longer tolerate the political differences with t=
he=20
President over the senate bribery scandal. Particularly Alvarez disagreed=
=20
with De la Rua's decision to promote Alberto Flamarique from Minister of=20
Labor to General Secretary and to keep Fernando de Santiba=0Fez as Chief of=
 the=20
Intelligence Department.  Both Flamarique and Santiba=0Fez are suspected of=
=20
paying bribes to Senators to vote for a new Labor Law. Alvarez has=20
emotionally championed the fight against the senate scandal and has been=20
strongly advocating for the resignation of Flamarique, Santiba=0Fez and all=
=20
Senators involved in the affair.=20

It was considered that the decision of De la R?a was intended to demonstrat=
e=20
that he, and not Alvarez, holds the power and that De la R?a wanted to=20
demonstrate that the changes were focused on improving the economic situati=
on=20
and to move beyond the Senate scandal.

The main changes in the cabinet, announced on Thursday 5th, are the followi=
ng:
Chistian Colombo (economist, in good relationship with Machinea) will repla=
ce=20
Terragno as Chief of Cabinet.
Machinea (Minister of Economy) will also be responsible of the Ministry of=

Infrastructure.=20
Jorge De la R?a (former General Secretary of the President and President's=
=20
brother) will be Minister of Justice.=20
Patricia Bullrich (peronist) will be Minister of Labor.=20

As a consequence of Alvarez' resignation, Flamarique resigned to his positi=
on=20
of General Secretary of the President.

Regarding the preliminary impact of the political changes to the economic=
=20
situation it could be considered the following:

Before Alvarez resignation, the cabinet changes were considered positive=20
intending to increase the power of  the Minister of Economy and reduce the=
=20
internal disagreements in the Administration.
Although Alvarez (the leader of the Frepaso party) said he will be still pa=
rt=20
of the ""Alianza"" (the Radical and Frepaso party alliance) in Office, Alvare=
z'=20
resignation could lead to the division of the Alianza and reduce the abilit=
y=20
of De la Rua to pass new laws in the Congress. A breakup of the coalition=
=20
would make the Peronist the largest party in both houses of Congress only=
=20
compounding the potential for government gridlock =20
This situation will weaken De la Rua and probably foster new re-alignments =
in=20
the political field.
All the situation will increase economic uncertainty and will delay economi=
c=20
recovery. The market will wait to see if a conflict develops in the Alianza=
.
De la Rua and his team will probably be forced to take ""strong"" decisions t=
o=20
retain the political initiative, strength and control.
Machinea will probably try to gain the market confidence, announcing that D=
e=20
la Rua's Administration will not change the macro foundations of the econom=

agenda and even increase its commitment toward monetary and fiscal=20
equilibrium, exchange rate policy, respect for vested rights, etc.

Financial analysts have viewed the situation as ""an institutional crisis wi=

RLC Increases New Jersey TV Ad Buy 
As Franks-Corzine Race Tightens 
Budget-Busting, Anti-Taxpayer Corzine Issues 
Beginning To Impact Senate Race

?Washington, DC -- The Republican Leadership Council (RLC) announced that it 
will increase its existing New Jersey TV ad buy by an additional $250,000, 
beginning immediately, and will step up efforts to point out the fiscal 
profligacy associated with Democrat Jon Corzine's economic platform. 

?""We're clearly making headway in our effort to educate New Jersey taxpayers 
about the real cost of Corzine's ideas for big government, and we're going to 
turn up the volume of our TV buy in New Jersey,"" said Mark Miller, Executive 
Director of the RLC.? ""The bottom line is that Jon Corzine's irresponsible 
'free lunch' big spending schemes will ruin our economic prosperity, and send 
the nation back into deficit spending."" 

?The RLC ad, which will be extended in both the Philadelphia and New York 
markets, charges that Corzine's spending programs would cost the average 
taxpayer $5,000 per year, and quotes a newspaper editorial saying that, 
""Corzine's... schemes would come at a tremendous cost to taxpayers."" 

?Meanwhile, a new Quinnipiac College survey of 909 likely New Jersey voters 
released today shows GOP candidate Bob Franks within five points, 46%-41%, 
even after being outspent by Corzine by record margins. 

?Miller noted that the new survey shows Corzine with an unimpressive 30% - 
26% Favorable/ Unfavorable rating overall, and evenly split among 
independents at 26%. 

?""Because Corzine's message is based almost entirely on giving away taxpayers 
dollars for government program after government program, taxpayers are 
looking more skeptically at his proposals,"" said Miller.? ""New Jersey 
taxpayers don't believe Corzine should spend their money as recklessly as he 
spends his own money.""

I hope this email finds you looking forward to the approching holiday

and express my interest in Enron for my future. My name is Dulari Mehta and
we first met at the Davenport Society Dinner in October at the University of
Missouri-Columbia. I was escorting Mr. Walker and I was sitting at your

in November. On both occasions I enjoyed speaking with you and exchanging
ideas about India.

As this semester closes and I begin to plan my next one, I am looking at
opportunites that await me once I graduate in May of 2001. I have spent some
time looking at your website and I am very intersted in Enron as a possible
place to work. I am especially interested in your project management area
and/or international opportunities. I have attached my resume to this email.
I would love to hear from you as to your thoughts on my resume and a
possible future at Enron.

All my current and permanent contact information is on my resume. I will be
out of the country and in India from December 22 to January 13. I hope you

Subject: Orion Refinery

Mr. Nicholas (Nick) Tell, Managing Director of the Trust Company of the West 
(TCW) has invited Enron Global Fuels to attend a meeting on Wednesday, 
November 29 at 3:00pm at the Orion Refinery in Norco, La. with the following 
individuals:

Mr. David Matlin, Managing Director Workouts & Special Situations of Credit 
Suisse/First Boston
Mr. George Sutherland, Vice President Commercial of Orion Refining Corp.
Mr. Clark Johnson, President of Orion Refining Corp. (formerly with Frontier)
Mr. Nicholas Tell

The purpose of this meeting is to follow up on a meeting with CSFB last week 
and a conversation with Mr. Tell today to explore opportunities between Enron 
and Orion. These opportunities may include crude oil supply, refined products 
offtake, risk management services and possible financing of refinery 
improvements that may be repaid in products rather than cash. 

Note--ownership of this refinery is broken out as follows--CSFB (68%), 
Jefferies (18%), TCW (10%) and Oaktree (4%). Jack Stanley is totally out of 
the picture. The refinery is currently running at 145,000 bpd and is badly in 
need of a reformer which would be at least a 15 month project.

Dear Mr. Lay:

Here's the newly completed Enterprise version of our white paper, and the
Service Provider version is being finished now. I'll send that along as soon
as it's ready.

After you and your associates read it, I think you'll discover that we
provide a VPN tool that eases provisioning of Nortel Contivity, Cisco IOS,
Altiga and PIX, as well as VPN management and security policy auditing. This
would compliment your existing solutions and greatly expand your ability to
penetrate the market with your product offering.

Let me know technical questions you come up with and I'll get our CTO to
answer them for you.

Subject: TBD Networks VPN Initiative


Dear Mr. Lay:

Because you were recognized Business Week in 1999  for ""taking Enron into
the red-hot communications industry"" by ""developing an intelligent network
platform to facilitate online business and building a market for trading
bandwidth"", we'd like to get your opinion on how we can contribute to your
initiative.

TBD Networks is a Secure VPN Management software company here in Silicon
Valley. We believe Enron could benefit from using our highly scalable
software to manage VPNs Enterprise-wide by:

1) Speeding up the setup and provisioning time for tens of thousands of
VPNs.
2) Uniquely Vendor-Independent: Supporting all types of VPNs (Remote
Access/Site-to-site/Extranet), based on equipment, products and technologies
from Cisco IOS, PIX, Altiga, Nortel and Check Point.
3) Reducing training and support needs by using our easy-to-use, web-based
GUI based on high-level policies, hiding low-level, vendor-specific
interfaces.
4) Providing significantly higher levels of security and control VPNs via
advanced features such as random policy auditing and proactive service
monitoring.

We would be very interested in meeting with someone at Enron to find out how
you would like to proceed. Who would you suggest we contact?

IMPRESSIVE LETTER FROM LIZ CHENEY PERRY



In this America of  
ours, where the passion for publicity is a disease and
where swarms of  
foolish tawdry moths dash with rapture into its consuming
fire, it was a rare  
good fortune that brought to eminence a man so reserved,
so unassuming, so  
retiring, so gracious to high and low, and so serene.&quot;
Judge Learned  
Hand in tribute to Justice Cardozo, 1938.

Here are some things America  
should know about my dad, Dick Cheney.? He
loves the mountains and  
rivers and prairies that stretch into forever in
Wyoming.? He is of the  
American West.? His handshake is firm.? He looks you
in the  
eye.? His word is his bond.? He is a world class listener, and  
when
he talks, it is always worth listening.? I have never known a wiser  
man.
To my three daughters, he is &quot;Papa.&quot;? Watching him with  
his granddaughters
is a great joy.?? My daughters are young and  
their concerns are the concerns
of little girls -- dolls and play-dough and  
first friends.? He has infinite
time for them, as he always has for my  
sister and me.? He is never rushed,
never hurried.? He is supremely  
kind, loving and patient - listening to
their latest song from school,  
reading bedtime stories, or teaching them how
to fish (a lesson Cheneys learn  
early). 
He grew up in Casper, Wyoming in the days when you could ride your  
bike out
of town and hunt rabbits on the prairie.? His dad, a World War  
II veteran,
was a career civil servant with the Soil Conservation  
Service.? His mom
worked as a secretary at Bustard's Funeral Home to  
make ends meet.? He
pitched for the local American Legion baseball  
team.? He owed much of his
skill to my grandmother, who had played for  
the Syracuse, Nebraska
Bluebirds, a nationally-ranked girls' softball  
team.? She caught his pitches
many evenings on their front lawn at 505  
Texas Place.
He was the first in his family to graduate from college.?  
He built
powerlines across Wyoming and Colorado to help pay his way.? He  
carried a
ticket for six years in the International Brotherhood of Electrical  
Workers.

He married his high school sweetheart, Lynne, in  
1964.?? One look at the
inscriptions they penned in each other's  
high school yearbooks and you know
they were as deeply in love at 18 as they  
are today.? He was the captain of
the football team and she was the  
homecoming queen.? Getting her elected was
his first political  
campaign.
There have been lots of other campaigns since then.? Despite  
his success,
he's not a typical politician.? He's not a  
glad-hander.? He's not a
fast-talker.? He's not slick.? He is  
who he is.? He is real and honest and
true.? 
He loves this  
country.? He knows how blessed we all are to be Americans.?  
He
taught my sister and me that we owe everything we have to the brave men  
and
women who died so that we could be free.? When we were young, he  
took us to
the battlefields where the Civil War was fought.? He taught  
us to love
history and to revere this great nation.???  
Serving as Secretary of Defense was the greatest honor of his life.? I  
have
heard him say that this was because of the troops, the men and women of  
the
U.S. military.? I went with him to Arlington National Cemetery the  
day of
the memorial service for the servicemen and women who died in the  
Persian
Gulf War.?? I stood next to him in the amphitheater with  
the families who
had lost sons and daughters, husbands and wives, watching as  
the military
jets flew overhead in the missing man formation.? It was  
the first time I
ever saw tears in his eyes. 
There are cynics today who  
would have us believe that no politician is a man
of honor.? Maybe the  
last eight years have done this to us.? I hope not.
There are good  
people in American politics today; honorable and wise people,
people who keep  
their word and inspire us to live lives of goodness and
truth.? There  
are leaders among us.? 
In Governor Bush and my father, America has the  
chance to vote for two of
these men this Election Day.

I just wanted to make sure that you knew that Ken does plan to do this.? He 
did talk to Governor Knowles. 

Thanks.

Subject:? Governors Conference 



Dear Ken, 

It was good to talk with you last week, and I hope you got some vacation in 
Aspen.? I'm working at it! 

Rosalie said you'd be getting in this afternoon, and I? wanted to reach you 
by phone or e-mail before Governor Tony Knowles from Alaska calls you. 
Governor Knowles (classmate of George W.), along with Governor Taft of 
Ohio, has enlisted us in a conference that seven governors are sponsoring 
on natural gas in order to elucidate the market and issues -- and needs -- 
before it explodes as a political issue -- and perhaps helps head it off 
(in contrast to what happened with gasoline).? Governor Knowles is the 
current chairman of the Interstate Oil Compact Commission, and it will be 
under the auspices of the IOCC.? They promise at least seven governors and 
a lot of other distinguished people.? It seems to us that this is a very 
timely event. 

They would like to invite you to be the luncheon speaker.? (I will be 
kicking off the conference).?? It looks to be a very good and high 
visibility platform.? And they would be very keen and excited -- and 
honored -- to have you in that featured role in it works for your schedule. 

It takes place in Columbus, Ohio, on September 20. 

Tony is a very good guy, and of course natural gas as well as oil looms 
very large for him.? You'll enjoy talking with him.? He can certainly fill 
you in further on what they would like to accomplish. 

If it works out for you to do this in terms of your schedule and interest, 
that would be great. 

On behalf of the governors, thank you for the consideration. 

Best, 

Dan

Increasingly, Enron=01,s integrated products and services require the appro=

We also want to reach the elected and appointed officials who set policy an=

Enron commercials continue to appear on business channels such as CNBC and=

Mr. Lay,

I wasn't able to get my question to you at the all employee meeting. It was=
=20
this:

The Enron sponsored Houston mini-cart Grand Prix entry placed second and=20
received free air time of ""Enron"" on the news. With NASCAR being as popular=
=20
as it is today, itself a multi-billion dollar industry, why hasn't Enron=20
sponsored a racing team to compete against the other Fortune 500 sponsors?=
=20
Enron is supporting stadiums, but why not a competition based on fuel,=20
energy, and the most powerful being the victor?

Now with cigarettes and alcohol banned from advertising, companies such as=
=20
AOL, Compaq, Southern Company, and Infoseek are on the tracks. Each race=20
would provide more airtime of the Enron logo and further placement of ""The=

We'd like to sincerely thank you for heading our way and helping us kick off 
the official opening of Enron's businesses in Japan.  The feedback that we 
have received has been very positive and the website has been a big hit.  
Preliminary figures for the Enron Japan website look promising.  We've had 
over 12,000 page hits over the last three days with an average of >300 unique 
visitors per day.  We have also received quite a few requests for the 10% 
discount product.  The utilities are scrambling to try and understand what 
the product is and why we are doing this.

I also wanted to pass along that while the TEPCO meeting was probably in line 
with what we expected, our interpreter made it clear to me that the TEPCO

Alright, it is beginning, I need to receive from all parties the lists for 
the wedding/ engagement party. I'm not sure what ettiquette is appropriate, 
i.e. if people invited to the engagement party are automatic guests at the 
wedding, but I plan on buying the book, whatever it may be. However, I would 
like to receive your lists, including family, with addresses so Jose Luis and 
I can start composing a master list. He is doing the same with his parents. I 
know, Dad and Linda, you are in the middle of moving and giong out of town, 
etc. but I can start with Mark and Natalie's list and then change as needed.
Thanks,

First off, I have a friend who is setting up a plant in Corcoran,
Northern Calif., to manufacture a welded reinforcement grid building
building structural systems.  They will need 480V/1200 amp. service.  I
suggested that they would be better off making an electricity provision
agreement with you rather than PG&E.

His name is Hans Bauman.  He can be reached at 949-640 2880.  Please
have your people contact him ASAP as he plans to open for business in
November.

Next, the Aspen Accord conference in Sweden went extraordinarily well
... especially with the California issues in such abound.  Commissioner
Wood was there along with the mayors etc. of the cities.  I know that
there is a business opportunity that can be developed and would be
pleased, when the timing is right to discuss this with you.  After all
Ken, your California experience should show that improvement in your
position in the marketplace could be better.

Why not, on your next trip to Aspen, give me a call and drop by Orange
County airport and I'll ride up with you.  We can talk about what I see
as lost opportunities and how to capture them.

My new life is going amazingly well.  I'm working in an advisory
capacity in California, Chicago and Sweden ... and taking time to 'smell
the roses'.  Hope you are doing the same.

Best regards,

John

MyHomeKey.com has been funded in large part by TXU and KeySpan Energy.   As 
you well know these utilities are some of our primary competitors.  With this 
in mind we discussed some potential ideas.  Mick is to check to see if they

I read with interest today about Enron on your corporate web site and your
recognition as one of the top U.S. CEOs. Such success usually results from a
history of strong business and customer relationships. With this in mind, I
felt compelled to bring my one and only experience with Enron to your
attention.

I am President, CEO of Xign Corporation located in Pleasanton, CA.  Our
company is developing software for electronic payments.  Our board of
directors includes Charles Schwab and Bob Kimmitt (former U.S. Ambassador to
Germany and President of Commerce One).

Our company signed an intent last June with Enron to sublease an office
building.  My team worked in good faith with Enron people for 5 months
waiting for a draft lease.  During this period we were delayed time and
again by ""lack of legal resources"" to complete the contract.  Last month we
were told that Enron still wanted to lease the space, but the vacancy would
be delayed one month (from the original October 15th date).  Two weeks ago
we were told that a November date was at risk and the lease could not be
signed.

This week the Enron representative told us (1) there is no occupancy date
that can be established and (2) Enron is not willing or interested in
telling us when we they can set a date.  End of conversation.

Our company has pursued this matter for six months with assurances by Enron
of their intention to move forward in good faith.  My company is now down to
100 days in our current lease in a market with very little available space.
This will materially effect our operation and our shareholders.  Enron did
not legally commit to the lease. But continued reassurances of the intent to
sign the lease, misled us.  We won't make a similar mistake in the future.

We all operate as members of a business community.  I'm sure my experience
with Enron is not reflective of your organization as a whole. I would
certainly appreciate if you could have someone look into this matter and
let us know if there might be a solution to this situation that works well
for all parties.

Thank you very much,

I mentioned in a voicemail today that you should be receiving a phone call 
from James (Jimbo) Moffet (504) 582-4000.  He is Chairman of Freeport McMahon 
in New Orleans.  James had mentioned to Thomas Boettcher & Michael Hutchinson 
in our Metals group that he knew you and wanted to make sure you were 
supportive of our discussions with them.  Here is the background on a 
possible acquisition that we have brought up with them:

            Enron Metals is very interested in pursuing further discussions 
with Atlantic Copper on the acquisition of their smelter in Spain.  Estimated 
capital would be US$350 Million.  Acquiring this asset gives us the 
opportunity to build copper and copper concentrate positions and more 
effectively managing our positions in the market place. We would finance this 
off balance sheet.

 Mr. James Targetta, head of Atlantic Copper (copper smelter and refinery in 
Spain and fully owned by Freeport McMoran) had a conversation with James 
Moffet, Chairman of Freeport McMoran last Friday informing him about our 
preliminary conversations.   Moffet advised Targetta not to proceed further 
until he speaks to you since he has known you for 25 years.  

 In addition, Targetta mentioned the possibility for Enron purchasing all the 
copper mining activities of  Freeport McMoran which would leave them as an 
oil and exploration company.

We think there are some great possibilities here.    

If you have not heard from him in the next few days, I would really 
appreciate you giving Moffet a call.   I would be more than happy to get a 
more extensive briefing for you if you think you need it.   I look forward to 
discussing this further with you.

us to constantly reevaluate our priorities, our methods of getting things=

done, and whether our organization is properly structured to meet the needs=

of the entire company.  While we have done an outstanding job as a group=20

The primary change in the organizational structure is to complete the=20

3. Enron Broadband Services:  Sue Nord
4. Enron Global Markets and Enron Networks:  Lisa Yoho

With the impending retirement on March 31, 2001 of Joe Hillings, I am pleas=

2000, as a Vice President who will immediately assume responsibility for=20

On a personal note, I would like to acknowledge the significant contributio=

over the next days and weeks.

I will be relying heavily on the above-identified six individuals to ensure=

Communicating that understanding on a regular basis to the rest of the=20

In order to ensure the success of these individuals and the Government=20

In addition to his leadership role with Government Affairs on behalf of the=

Tom Hoatson will now report to Steve Montovano in his new role in supportin=

   HOUSTON (AP) - Houston-based <B>Reliant</B> <B>Energy</B> Inc., has won
the naming
rights for the stadium that will be the home of the NFL's Houston
Texans, Houston TV station KRIV reported Tuesday.



  According to KRIV, the 30-year deal is worth $300 million.

   The 69,500-seat retractable-roofed stadium is on schedule to open for
the start of the 2002 NFL season. It is being constructed just yards
away from the Astrodome.
   The new stadium, billed as the only football stadium with a
retractable roof, will have 1.9 million square feet compared with 1.1
million in the Astrodome.

I spoke to Bonnie today regarding the letter I sent you on September
12th.  Bonnie suggested I follow-up that letter with this email.

With only 49 days to the election, we expect to see the oppositions'
advertisements on television and radio and in the mail in the next two
weeks.  It's crucial to our ability to be competitive that we complete
our media buys and print our next two direct mail pieces by October
1st.  If we do, we know that we can win.

Your initial contribution of $100,000 allowed us to do the first direct
mail piece to 250,000 households (a sample was included with the letter
I sent to you on the 12th).  We need to do at least two more of these
mailings for our direct mail effort to be truly effective at a total
cost of $190,000 for both (including postage).

To date, the combined total of contributions to the political campaign
and the public education campaign is just over $1,040,000.  We expect an
additional $150,000 in pledges and new contributions in the next two to
three weeks.  While we are actively soliciting others for help, we are
currently left with a shortfall of $310,000 to meet our minimum budget
of $1.5 million.  (This budget would include the production and mailing
of the three mail pieces described above)

Ken, the campaign is at a crossroads.  I cannot underscore enough how
important your additional financial help is at this time.  And, I cannot
underscore enough how important one last significant contribution from
you would be to our success on November 7th.

If you have any questions, or need additional information, please do not
hesitate to call me at (573) 446-3129 or reply to this email message.

Thank you for your past support and, hopefully, your additional
support.  Passing Proposition A is a once in a generation opportunity.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

Karl",LAY-K

Just a reminder that your portfolio company presentations are due on Monday

has a copy to include in the mailing paket to him by 4PM on Monday.  If you 
are not planning to meet that deadline, please see Lilia about how you can 
get your presentation to Gene.

The first drafts were a good start.  Most, however, read more like a pitch  
[Paige, Barbara]  than an assessment/evaluation.  As you make your revisions, 
keep in mind that your objective should be to provide a succinct, but 
thorough assessment of the investment that will inform a discussion on how to 
best add value and manage the investment going forward.

If you have not gotten my feedback and would like it, we can arrange to speak 
over the weekend.  I will be traveling, but if you leave a voice message, we 
can arrange a time to speak.  I will be generally available by phone Saturday 
morning through early afternoon.

 Study Shows Efficacy of Zyprexa Superior to Valproate in the Treatment of
               Acute Mania Associated with Bipolar Disorder
          Study is the largest comparison of two mood stabilizers


Zyprexac (olanzapine, Lilly) provides better control of manic symptoms

during treatment of acute manic or mixed manic episodes compared with

valproate (Depakotec, Abbott), according to new data presented today at the

13th European College of Neuropsychopharmacology Congress (ECNP) in Munich.

The study is the first head-to-head comparison of Zyprexa and valproate

since the FDA's approval of the use of Zyprexa for bipolar mania in March.



Key Findings

Dosing was based on both drugs' package inserts (see Study Design for more

information). The study's primary efficacy measure was the Young-Mania

Rating Scale (Y-MRS), an 11-item scale used to assess the severity of a

patient's mania. Key study endpoint findings included:



?    The Zyprexa group experienced a significantly greater improvement on
the Y-MRS total score than did patients treated with valproate (49% vs.
38%).
?    A greater proportion of Zyprexa patients achieved remission from manic
symptoms (defined as Y-MRS Total Score < 12) compared with valproate
patients (47% vs. 34%).
?    54% of patients on Zyprexa experienced a 50% or more improvement in
Y?MRS scores compared with 42% of the valproate patients.
?    Zyprexa patients demonstrated a statistically significant improvement
in certain Y-MRS Individual Item Scores compared with valproate patients:
activity/energy (53% vs. 41%), sleep (69% vs. 45%) and language-thought
disorder (49% vs. 35%).  Changes in other core symptoms of mania as defined
by the Y-MRS Individual Item Scores were similar for the two treatment
groups.




Study Design

The three-week, randomized, parallel, double-blind, acute-phase study

examined 251 hospitalized patients at 44 sites who met the DSM-IV criteria

for a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder and were experiencing acute manic or

mixed episodes. Subjects received olanzapine in a flexible dose range of 5

to 20 mg/day (once daily) or valproate in a flexible does range of 500 to

2,500  mg/day (multiple doses per day). The mean ending dose for Zyprexa

was 17 mg/day and the mean ending dose for valproate was 1500 mg/day. In

addition, plasma levels were monitored to ensure valproate trough levels

were maintained within the targeted therapeutic range of 50-125 ?g/mL; the

mean value of all levels obtained was 79.4 ?g/mL. Clinicians determined

dosing based on each patient's clinical response as well as the blood

levels in patients taking valproate. Lorazepam use was restricted to a

maximum dose of 2 mg/day, and administration was prohibited within eight

hours of a psychiatric exam.



Additional Study Results

Neither Zyprexa nor valproate induced depressive symptoms in bipolar manic

or mixed patients.  In fact, both Zyprexa and valproate patients showed an

improvement in depressive symptoms as measured by the Hamilton Depression

Rating Scale (HAMD-21).  However, Zyprexa patients showed greater

improvement at the study endpoint in HAMD-21 scores (35% vs. 24%).  The

effects of Zyprexa have not yet been studied in bipolar depression.



Zyprexa was generally well tolerated. The most common and significantly

different adverse events for Zyprexa were somnolence (39.2% vs. 20.6% for

valproate), dry mouth (33.6% vs. 6.3%), and increased appetite (12.0% vs.

2.4%).  The most common adverse event for valproate was nausea (28.6% vs.

10.4% for Zyprexa). Additional safety information for Zyprexa and valproate

can be obtained from their package inserts.



""These data support the value of Zyprexa as a much needed treatment

option,"" said Mauricio Tohen, M.D., Dr. P.H., medical adviser, Lilly

Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, and lead investigator for the

study.  ""The findings provide further evidence that Zyprexa effectively

stabilizes mood in patients with bipolar disorder.""



Manic symptoms occur during the manic phase of bipolar disorder, a lifelong

illness characterized by disruptive swings in mood.  Symptoms include

abnormal elation and/or irritability, often accompanied by an unrealistic

belief in one's own abilities, increased sex drive, delusions and alcohol

or drug abuse.  People with bipolar disorder also may experience mixed

episodes, marked by symptoms of mania and clinical depression occurring

simultaneously. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,

Fourth Edition (DSM-IV).  American Psychiatric Association, 1994.


Zyprexa (olanzapine, Lilly)
valproate (Depakote, Abbott)


The study findings are particularly pertinent in light of valproate's

recent revised black box warning from the Food and Drug Administration

following reports of life-threatening pancreatitis in both children and

adults.



""Physicians have good reason to take these new data into account,"" said

Carlos A. Zarate, M.D., associate professor of psychiatry and director,

bipolar and psychotic disorders program, University of Massachusetts

Medical Center.  ""The efficacy of Zyprexa coupled with its favorable safety

profile suggest that it may provide a timely treatment alternative for

patients with bipolar disorder.""



Zyprexa is indicated in the United States for the management of the

manifestations of psychotic disorders as demonstrated in short-term

clinical trials with schizophrenia patients.  It is also approved for the

short-term treatment of acute manic episodes associated with bipolar

disorder.



In the original schizophrenia registration trials, olanzapine was generally

well tolerated.  However, as with all medications, olanzapine was

associated with some side effects.  In the original six-week, acute-phase

schizophrenia trials, the most common treatment-emergent adverse event

associated with olanzapine was somnolence.  Other common events were

dizziness, weight gain, constipation, akathisia (restlessness), and

postural hypotension.  Modest elevations of prolactin were also seen,

although mean changes from baseline to endpoint were not statistically

significantly different between olanzapine and placebo.  A small number of

patients experienced asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminase; none

of these patients developed jaundice or drug-induced hepatitis.



In short-term (three- and four-week) acute bipolar mania trials, the most

common treatment-emergent adverse event associated with olanzapine was

somnolence.  Other common events were dry mouth, dizziness, asthenia,

constipation, dyspepsia, increased appetite, and tremor.

Sally, Could you please see that Ken gets this? What is his email address? I
dont have it. The work that Loyal and his staff have done on this is
impressive, even though it took a long time for me to bring this up on my

Hi Bonnie whose girdle one time exploded. Do you
remember that incident??? Kenny and I still
remember! The reason for the message is that I
wanted to send you the address of  LFGA which is
as follows:
http://www.geocities.com/heartland/acres/8896/index.html
       You should look at Line #4 which is our
line of the Lay family. Turn your speakers on
cause you will hear some music. I am now the
President of this organization so I am trying to
get my all of my line to pay some attention to
their lineage.  We just got back from North West
Arkansas. Looking at some housing. Thinking of
making a move. Regards-Loyal

Dear Governing Board member,

This is just let you know that three of our Board members - Victor Menezes
(Citibank), PC Chatterjee (The Chatterjee Group), and Uday Khemka (the SUN
Group of Industries) - are co-hosting a fund-raising dinner for the ISB on
Tuesday, May 16, 2000 in New York. While I understand this is short notice,
in case you are in New York on that date and also available for dinner, we
will be delighted if you could join us. Rajat, Dean Jacobs, and a number of
other Board members and supporters will also be there.

Please block off the date on your calendar and let me know if it is
possible for you to attend. We will be sending out a formal invitation in a
few days. Also, do let us know if you have any suggestions on who we should
invite for the event.

Please also note that the next meeting of the ISB Governing Board will be
held in New York on Thursday, September 28 from about noon to 6PM.

With best regards,

Pramath Sinha

Earlier this year when the decision was made to purchase our new GV aircraft, 
we agreed to move forward with plans to sell one of our Falcon 900B's by 
year-end.

This allows for Aviation to maintain a six aircraft domestic fleet, once the 
GV is delivered and operational at the beginning of the 2nd quarter of next 
year.  Our '01 budget forecast is based on this assumption.

A year-end sale avoids ad valorem tax issues.  It reduces our fleet to five 
during the 1st quarter, which is also the limit that we can operate aircraft, 
i.e., several pilots unavailable (at GV flight training during this period).

Gary Fitch advises that Jeff and Joe do not have a preference on which 
aircraft to sell.  Gary prefers selling the Falcon 900B (#N5733), since it 
has only one lavatory.  The aircraft is 12 years old, in excellent condition, 
and has a market value of $20-22 million (lease buy-out of $19 million).

With your concurrence, we will contract with an aircraft broker and place the 
Falcon on the market.

Subject: UTC Sales Call

At UTC's request, yesterday Mike Jackson and I met with Kent Brittan, VP, 
Global Sourcing, and members of his sourcing group.  As you remember, we 
first met Kent when Tom White, Dan Leff, Harold Buchanan and I called on him 
two years ago.  At the time, we presented an early version of a fully bundled 
energy outsource in partnership with Fluor Daniel and a local real estate 
management firm.

Over the last two years, UTC attempted various energy procurement strategies, 
failing to execute any.  

Brittan was very pleased with the content of our revised proposal yesterday, 
and told us he would be taking the revised partnership strategy we discussed 
directly to George David, CEO.  

Brittan will also be taking the preliminary concept to UTC Corporate 
Treasury, to gain its buy in on the financing aspects of the deal required to 
support the demand side management infrastructure investments it so 
desperately needs to affect the energy  consumption reduction to which David 
committed two years ago.

Barring a problem there, it appears we have finally engaged UTC in an 
exclusive negotiating relationship that would yield a large scale outsource 
of energy supply and demand side investment operations in all the UTC 
companies, excepting Carrier.    Carrier continues to insist it be treated 
separately, and Brittan has decided to carve it out, rather than hold up the 
entire deal.  I think that strategy is part of what he will be speaking to 
David about.

I requested, and Brittan agreed, that Karl Kropic (COO) be the executive 
sponsor.

Mike Jackson who has worked on and off with UTC over the past 18 months will 
be the lead Originator for EES moving forward.

Dear Ken: 

As discussed I would appreciate your meeting with the CM even for a few 
minutes at Davos. I will find soem time in ur schedule to brief you for that 
meeting before you leave for Davos.

The CM considers u as a personal friend now that u have arranged for him to 
be invited to Davos. In fact he has also requested you personally whether you 
can arrange a meeting with Bill Gates while he is there. That would probably 
be impossible given everyone's schedule there and my message for that to the 
CM is going to be that eaxctly that... the schedules look impossible to 
arrange that.

However for your meeting, I would appreciate giving us some time.

Regards,
Sanjay

=DJ Enron, Powerex Investigated For Alberta Price Fixing
11/21/0 15:31 (New York)



      By Cheryl Devoe Kim
      Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

  TORONTO (Dow Jones)--Canada's Competition Bureau raided the offices of Enron
Canada Corp. in Calgary and Powerex Corp. in Vancouver earlier this year as
part of an investigation into suspected electricity price fixing by the two
companies, according to documents obtained by Dow Jones Newswires.
  Bureau investigator David Bloom alleges in an application for a warrant he
used to gain access to the offices that in the summer of 1999, Powerex and
Enron were coordinating bid restatements and inflating the price each received
for electricity as they traded on the Power Pool of Alberta.
  The investigation hasn't yet produced any charges against either of the
companies, according to Enron. The Competition Bureau declined to comment on
the status of the case.
  Both Enron Corp. (ENE), which owns Enron Canada, and Powerex, a unit of
provincially owned British Columbia Hydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), deny
breaking any rules or laws.
  From Powerex's point of view, Albertans are looking for someone to blame for
high power prices, which have become a political issue in the province.
  ""They just find it easy to blame us for what are pretty fundamental market
design flaws,"" Powerex president and chief executive Ken Peterson told Dow
Jones Newswires in an interview.
   Deregulation Spurs Search For Someone To Blame
  The search for someone to blame has repeated itself across every 
deregulating
market Enron has participated in, Enron Corp. spokesman Mark Palmer said.
  ""Almost every time that either power markets or natural gas markets or even
oil markets or gasoline markets have experienced any kind of price volatility,
there have been investigations done,"" Palmer said.
  Enron has been scrutinized before as part of wider energy markets
investigations, he said, but never found to be breaking the rules. This is the
first such investigation into Powerex's actions, Peterson said.
  The Competition Bureau, based in Ottawa, won't say whether the investigaion
is ongoing, citing disclosure rules under the Competition Act.
  The companies themselves said they're not sure of the investigation's 
status.
Their seized files were returned several months ago, but Powerex hasn't heard
from the Bureau since then. Enron did receive a call from the Bureau last week
with a question, according to Enron Corp. spokesman Eric Thode.
  The investigation began when the Power Pool of Alberta's system controllers
noticed the clearing price for a megawatt of electricity was topping C$100 
with
unusual frequency.
  The Pool's price is set by participants submitting bids to buy or sell power
for the following day. Until Oct. 19, 1999, a bidder could restate the amount
of power in a bid or offer an unlimited number of times, until 20 minutes
before the hour of transmission. The price paid for every megawatt of power
needed by the Pool in a given hour is set by the most expensive unit needed to
meet demand.
   Alleged Bid Rigging Methods Detailed
  According to the Competition Bureau search warrant application, Powerex and
Enron were rigging their bids in the following manner:
  Powerex would lower the volume of an existing offer. As little as two 
minutes
later, Enron would increase its offer for the same period by the same volume,
but at a ""significantly higher price,"" according to the warrant application.
Sometimes, Enron would increase its offer even before Powerex had dropped its
offer.
  Power Pool market analyst Owen Craig, who once worked in Enron Canada's gas
trading group, found that ""as a result of restatements, involving mostly
Powerex and Enron,"" the Pool price was raised once to C$200/MWh, four times to
between C$354.29 and C$499.93, three times to between C$500 and C$541.63, and
10 times to between C$801.02 and C$998.
  Based on the restatement patterns, Craig, and then the Bureau's Bloom,
concluded that no new energy was being offered to the Pool. They believed the
power was just being transferred from Powerex to Enron and then offered at the
higher price, according to the warrant application. By cutting the volume
offered by Powerex, the more expensive power offered by Enron would likely be
needed, and every participant would get the higher price.
  Powerex's Peterson doesn't take issue with the trade history as detailed by
the Bureau, but denies that the company's traders were doing anything wrong or
that the two companies had some sort of arrangement.
  ""And we're adamant about that,"" Peterson said. ""There was no deal with 
Enron.
There was no expectation about what their behavior would lead to in terms of a
change in prices or anything like that.""
  Powerex traders were merely locking in their price, cutting the company's
risk, which Enron agreed to take on by buying the power at a fixed price,
Peterson said.
  ""Whenever Enron's offer of high-priced energy was declined, within moments 
of
Enron being advised by the Pool that their energy would not be required,
Powerex would restate an identical volume of energy back into its lower priced
unit,"" according to the warrant application.
  Peterson's response: ""We're operating in a very tight market there and we
felt an obligation to make sure the power got delivered into Alberta.""
  Enron also denies it broke any Power Pool rules or Canadian laws.
  ""It boils down to we were offered power at a price lower than we thought we
could sell it at,"" Enron's Thode said. ""And that's what Enron and every other
company does that's in the business of trading.""
  The May 25 search warrant covers the companies' actions between June 1, 
1999,
and Oct. 19, 1999. On Oct. 20, 1999, the Pool changed its restatement rules,
essentially closing the loophole, though it did so without ever making public
its investigation into Powerex and Enron.
  Power Pool spokesman Wayne St. Amour declined to discuss details of the
investigation.
  ""Market surveillance is in place to, among other things, protect the
interests and activities of market participants,"" he said.
  Those convicted under Canadian law for bid-rigging can be fined an amount at
the court's discretion and/or jailed up to five years. A conviction wouldn't
likely affect Powerex's ability to trade in the U.S., Peterson said. In Canada
""there would have to have some follow-on action by the Alberta parties to
inhibit that. And so far, they still like to get our power.""
  Companies Concerned About Reputations
  The bigger problem, Peterson said, is what the case will do to the Powerex
reputation.
  ""Essentially both companies are concerned about it because we have a lot at
stake from a reputational point of view,"" Peterson said. ""Both companies, I
believe, conduct themselves in the highest possible standard. But these are
difficult times in the business with prices going crazy in Alberta and
California and people looking for somebody to blame. There's always a
possibility of collateral damage when politics gets involved.""
  Powerex parent company BC Hydro is also suspected by the Power Pool of
Alberta of unfairly providing access to transmission through British Columbia,
linking Washington with Alberta, as detailed in an Oct. 13 Power Pool market
surveillance report. Again, no charges have been laid.

We are an early stage e-commerce company that offers the
world's largest selection of wildlife merchandise. We are ready
to obtain our first round of financing.  We would like
to have 5 co-branding partners who would receive equity positions in
our company.  We would incorporate their logo throughout our site and
include their PR materials with each order shipped.  Target partners
would include the utility and energy companies.  Since your
company is active in this market, you may know of someone who can assist
us.

We see utility/energy companies as a compatable fit because of their
interest in projecting a positive wildlife/environmental image.

About our company:

WildlifeCollectibles.Com is a specialty catalog company featuring
wildlife merchandise.  We have the world's largest selection of wildlife
merchandise.  Currently in the wildlife merchandise niche
there are no entities offering broad merchandise selections for each
animal specie.  We are filling this void by operating 22 ""sub-niche""
stores under the WildlifeCollectibles.Com brand.  These 22 storefronts
will represent 105 wildlife species.  Seven of these storefronts are
operational and the backend inventory systems are complete for the other
15.  We are in the process of loading them on the Internet.

One major component not yet installed on our site is our ""Facts About
the Specie"" page.  We will have reference information available for
every wildlife specie listed on our site.  At present,
there is no central repository of reference material available for most
species.  Britanica.com has reference information available for only 11
species.  This will attract school age children with their parents
tagging along.

We are looking for a total of 5 million dollars.  In order to assist
companies in purchasing an equity position/co-branded arrangement with
us, we are willing to finance their investment.  We will take $25,000.00
a month for 40 months from 5 corporate partners.  This will allow them
to budget the expense through Public Relations or Marketing.

I hope I have given you enough information to understand what
we would like to do, so you can either assist us or point us in the
right direction.  We would pay a commission and provide a small equity
stake in our company to the individual who signs on the utility/energy
companies for us.

 Involvement as a Potential Service Provider to Enron's EnHome Computer
 Employee Benefit Initiative","Ken:

One of the initiatives implemented at Global Strategic Souring since its 
formation in February is to leverage Enron's aggregated purchasing power to 
facilitate commercial development opportunities for the Business (EBS, EES, 
EFS, and etc.) Units.

Annually, Enron spends several million dollars with COMPAQ for servers, desk 
top computers, and lap top computers.  COMPAQ has also been selected as one 
of the potential candidates to service the EnHome program.  COMPAQ is also 
one of EBS's alliance partners.

Given the magnitude of Enron's relationship with COMPAQ, we have formed an 
intercompany team comprised of representatives from EBS, EES, EFS, Global 
Strategic Sourcing, and the EnHome Program.  In our most recent meeting the 
business units reported the following:

COMPAQ has failed to define its requirements for EBS services under the 
current alliance agreement between the companies.  COMPAQ has also denied EBS 
access to expertise and installations required for product refinement and 
implementation.  (Based on the feedback I have received, I question whether 
COMPAQ intends to honor the terms and conditions of its relationship with 
EBS).
EFS only provides building services currently to a couple of Compaq's 
installations.  
EES has been in discussions with COMPAQ for several months now.  Although we 
are progressing, it would appear that we are at an impasse on the language in 
the contract necessary to support the transaction.
On the EnHome program, COMPAQ has generally been unresponsive to our 
questions and concerns for clarification and/or additional information on 
their experience in operating this type of program.
The Widows 2000 Roll-out Contract literally has taken months to complete when 
it should have only been a matter of weeks.

Ken, based on what I am seeing day-to-day, I am concerned that COMPAQ has 
lost sight of the value of our total business and the value of a healthy, 
bidirectional relationship.

Therefore, specifically given the unresponsiveness to our most recent 
requests for clarification on the EnHome Program and our concerns regarding 
there ability to operate a program of this magnitude, I have requested that 
we reopen discussions with IBM and DELL.

I will keep you apprised of future developments.

Ken and Jeff,

As I think you both know I have been active in recruiting at Cornell for the 
Enron Associate program for several years now.  I also recently have become 
involved with something called the Park Leadership Fellowship Board which 
provides scholarships and forums to discuss business leadership issues.  They 
are holding a pretty prominent event called Leadership week which will 
include the business heads of Corning and American Express discussing their 
company's strategies for defining leadership in business today.  I hate to 
ask you guys to do things like this but it is a pretty big event and would 
really highlight Enron's recognition of Cornell as being a ""Core School"" in 
the MBA recruiting process.  The event as outlined below is scheduled for 
March 28th.  I appreciate your consideration.

Kevin

Kevin-


Just a quick follow-up on my November 2 email regarding Enron's
participation in the Johnson School's March Leadership Week and the
possibility of doing a case study on Enron.  Wondered if you have had a
chance to float these ideas with Jeff or Ken?  I know you have lots on
you plate.  Let me know if you have any sense of how this might go. 
Below is the earlier email I sent to you.  Thanks for the help.  Hope all
is well with you.


            Nov.2 email text


We at Cornell's Johnson School would like to establish a stronger link
with Enron, a company which we believe to be a leading example of the
agile organization which will dominate in the dynamic, unpredictable
markets of the next decade.  One connecting point which we would like
Enron to consider is with our Center for Leadership in Dynamic
Organizations which draws faculty and students from across Cornell and
beyond.


The specific activities that we propose at this point in time are two. 
First, we would like to invite a senior leader from Enron to be a key
speaker at the Johnson School's Leadership Week in March, 2001.  As
described in the attached materials, Leadership Week is made up of three
conferences focused on academic faculty, leading-edge corporations and
students.  We very much would like Enron to present what we call a ""live
case study"" at the corporate conference on <underline>March 28,
2001</underline>.


You, of course, are an obvious candidate to do this.  Alternatively, this
is the kind of event that is made to order for Jeff Skilling or Ken Lay
and would give them a chance to interact with other corporate leaders and
the Cornell community.  Other corporate leaders we have signed up for the
corporate conference are John Loose, President and COO of Corning, Ken
Chenault, incoming CEO of American Express, Marty Coyne, just announced
President of Kodak's new Commercial Group.  Each of these leaders has a
distinct message to deliver about the leadership challenges involved in
continually reinventing themselves in a fast-changing marketplace.  


We have several other speakers lined up for other parts of Leadership
Week, including Ken Blanchard and, we think, Abbey Cohen from Goldman
Sachs.  We have some chance of getting Bill Ford from Ford Motor Company
and an outside shot at Jack Welch through our President Emeritus Frank
Rhodes, but these are still long shots.


The point is that this is the biggest thing that will happen at the
Johnson School and probably at Cornell next year.  If Jeff or Ken wanted
a platform for telling the Enron story, this would be a good one.  If
they can't do it, hopefully we could convince you to do it.  Again, the
date is March 28, 2001.       


The second proposal is to develop a teaching case on Enron along the same
lines.  In fact, if we started working on the teaching case soon, it
could become the basis for the March conference live case study
presentation.  We believe that Enron is unique in its ability to
literally create new markets.  The question is how do you lead and manage
an organization to keep the tight financial and risk controls in place
that you do, but still create the entrepreneurial behavior that seems to
be the case at Enron.  What kind of management philosophies, systems and
practices make this possible.


I know that Enron was the subject of two Harvard cases in 1993 and around
1997.  As I understand it neither focused on organizational and
leadership issues.  We would like to devote a small research team to
building this case about Enron, directed by myself and Professor Lee Dyer
from the ILR School.  We would need access to a number of people in the
Enron organization, but are very aware of the demands on time for fast
moving organizations and are committed to doing this in a very efficient
way.


Kevin, we appreciate your willingness to entertain these two ideas and
hopefully test them with your top leaders.  We will do anything we can to
make it feasible for Enron to engage with us on these two initiatives. 
Please let me know what I can do to help you carry this forward.  As
always, thanks for your great personal support.


Dick

Chairman & C.E.O. 
Enron Corporation 

Dear Dr. Lay: 

I am writing to bring your attention to an important and timely event that 
will be held on September 20th at the Hyatt Regency Columbus, in Columbus, 
Ohio - ""The Governors' Natural Gas Summit: Responding to the Challenge."" This 
event is convened by the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC).? 
Co-chaired by Alaska Governor Tony Knowles, IOGCC Chairman and Ohio Governor 
Bob Taft, with the participation of other governors, this forum promises to 
be an outstanding exchange of ideas among leaders of government, energy 
producers, transporters, distributors, and end-users on the subject of the 
current and long-term outlook for natural gas resources and markets in North 
America. A very distinguished group of speakers is assembling, including 
senior government officials and senior executives of companies critically 
involved in the energy value chain.

Primary Goals of the Summit include: 

* Exploring and clearly communicating the current dynamics of the natural gas 
market 
* Informing the industry and the public about the current and future supply 
potential for gas 
* Providing governmental and industry leaders with an opportunity to discuss 
natural gas in the context of national energy policy, with the input of 
interested State Governors.

The Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC) and the governors have 
asked CERA to help organize the Summit and has invited senior CERA staff to 
moderate panel discussions on the Natural Gas Marketplace and the Supply 
Response for North America. In addition, I will be providing an opening 
framework for participants and contributing to the wrap-up of the Summit at 
the close of the day with the governors.? We are very pleased to be working 
with the governors and with the IOGCC and its executive director, Christine 
Hansen.

We hope that you can join us for this important event, and encourage you to 
view the Summit agenda on the IOGCC Web-site at: 
http://www.iogcc.state.ok.us/MEETINGS/2000_Governors_Natural_Gas_Summit.htm? 

On this site, you will also find complete registration information including 
fees, registration form, and logistics. 

You may also be interested in a recent Washington Post article on volatility 
in the gas and power markets, which helps provide a context for the 
discussion and which was co-authored by CERA Managing Director Tom Robinson 
and myself. This article may be found on the Washington Post Web-site at:

Dear  Ken,

 I am sorry to say that earlier this week Arthur Levitt was called to
testify in Congress early on September 28, and he felt unable to make our
session as originally planned. It is my hope that we can reschedule with him
prior to -- or in conjunction with -- the final report. For those who may
have changed their schedules to make this meeting because of the chance to
talk to Arthur, I regret the inconvenience.

 In deference to your time, we'll go ahead with the meeting from 5 to
7 but not with the dinner.

 Here are the details of the meeting.  Note that the location is
different from the previous two meetings.

     Wednesday, September 27 from 5 to 7
p.m.
     McKinsey & Company
     52 East 52nd Street, 23rd Floor
     New York, NY
     Check in on 23rd floor with Carol
Hubbard, who will direct you to the conference room
Phone: 212-446-8836

 Attached is the draft of our final report, prepared by Tim Koller.
It will be the subject of the meeting.  We will want to gather your comments
on the following:

     1.  Do you agree with the substance
of this draft?
     2.  Are there points that should
receive more or less emphasis?
     3.  Are there any other issues you
would like to raise?
     4.  Is there anything else about the
drafting and presentation that you would
like to comment on?

 We will need to get everyone's comments, one way or another, by the
end of September so we can proceed to prepare the final paper, which we'd
like to have ready by the end of October.

 Originally you said that you would not be able to make the meeting.
Could you let us know if your plans have changed and you can now come or
participate by phone?  See below for reply.

   ____ I will be there

   ____  I will participate by phone

               ____ I cannot make it at all but will

Dear Colette:

 In response to your e-mail concerning the upcoming New Delhi World Forum, I 
would expect that this forum should evaluate the impact of what is happening 
on our project at Dabohl with reference to enticing other foreign 
investment.  As you probably know, the State of Maharastra has been slow 
paying and no paying for the electricity from our plant at Dabohl for 
sometime and more recently both the State of Maharastra  and the Government 
of India have refused to honor their government guarantees on this project.  
We have filed a political force majeure on the project and indeed will be 
moving into arbitration on that and a number of other issues in London in the 
not too distant future.  Again, I believe this will send a very negative 
signal to the market place as to the advisability of international companies 
investing in India.  I would think you might want to build one panel around 
this subject.  

 If there's any way we can be of help, let me know.

Subject: India Economic Summit 2001, New Delhi 2-4 December


To the attention of:
Dr Kenneth L. Lay
Chairman
Enron


Dear Dr Lay,

When the Minister of Finance of India Yashwant Sinha recently presented the
2001-2002 national budget, it was widely acknowledged as a very ambitious
""dream budget"" which puts India on a high growth trajectory. Most key
sectors should benefit from these reforms, which will thus give a new boost
to the country's economic and social progress. As such, the budget was
welcomed with great enthusiasm by the Indian and international business
community.

On the occasion of our India Economic Summit 2001 to be held in partnership
with the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) from 2 to 4 December in New
Delhi, it will be the perfect time to assess the progress of the bold and
extensive measures proposed in the recent budget, how they have been
implemented and how they have impacted the business environment, domestic
industry activity and foreign investment.

As we will soon be preparing the preliminary programme of the Summit, I
would like to take the opportunity to benefit from your expertise and
understanding of the country. I would greatly appreciate receiving from you
any particular topics or issues that you wish to see given priority on the
agenda. Any suggestions of relevant speakers or experts that you may have
would also be welcomed.

I look forward to receiving your response at the above e-mail address and
kindly ask you to copy my colleague Mitra Khoubrou (e-mail:
mitra.khoubrou@weforum.org).

For more information on the 2001-2002 Union Budget, please visit the
website of the Ministry of Finance of India at http://finmin.nic.in/fub.htm

I look forward to hearing from you and hope that you will be with us in
India again next December.

As I think you both know I have been active in recruiting at Cornell for the 
Enron Associate program for several years now.  I also recently have become 
involved with something called the Park Leadership Fellowship Board which 
provides scholarships and forums to discuss business leadership issues.  They 
are holding a pretty prominent event called Leadership week which will 
include the business heads of Corning and American Express discussing their 
company's strategies for defining leadership in business today.  I hate to 
ask you guys to do things like this but it is a pretty big event and would 
really highlight Enron's recognition of Cornell as being a ""Core School"" in 
the MBA recruiting process.  The event as outlined below is scheduled for 
March 28th.  I appreciate your consideration.

Kevin-


Just a quick follow-up on my November 2 email regarding Enron's
participation in the Johnson School's March Leadership Week and the
possibility of doing a case study on Enron.  Wondered if you have had a
chance to float these ideas with Jeff or Ken?  I know you have lots on
you plate.  Let me know if you have any sense of how this might go. 
Below is the earlier email I sent to you.  Thanks for the help.  Hope all
is well with you.


            Nov.2 email text


We at Cornell's Johnson School would like to establish a stronger link
with Enron, a company which we believe to be a leading example of the
agile organization which will dominate in the dynamic, unpredictable
markets of the next decade.  One connecting point which we would like
Enron to consider is with our Center for Leadership in Dynamic
Organizations which draws faculty and students from across Cornell and
beyond.


The specific activities that we propose at this point in time are two. 
First, we would like to invite a senior leader from Enron to be a key
speaker at the Johnson School's Leadership Week in March, 2001.  As
described in the attached materials, Leadership Week is made up of three
conferences focused on academic faculty, leading-edge corporations and
students.  We very much would like Enron to present what we call a ""live
case study"" at the corporate conference on <underline>March 28,
2001</underline>.


You, of course, are an obvious candidate to do this.  Alternatively, this
is the kind of event that is made to order for Jeff Skilling or Ken Lay
and would give them a chance to interact with other corporate leaders and
the Cornell community.  Other corporate leaders we have signed up for the
corporate conference are John Loose, President and COO of Corning, Ken
Chenault, incoming CEO of American Express, Marty Coyne, just announced
President of Kodak's new Commercial Group.  Each of these leaders has a
distinct message to deliver about the leadership challenges involved in
continually reinventing themselves in a fast-changing marketplace.  


We have several other speakers lined up for other parts of Leadership
Week, including Ken Blanchard and, we think, Abbey Cohen from Goldman
Sachs.  We have some chance of getting Bill Ford from Ford Motor Company
and an outside shot at Jack Welch through our President Emeritus Frank
Rhodes, but these are still long shots.


The point is that this is the biggest thing that will happen at the
Johnson School and probably at Cornell next year.  If Jeff or Ken wanted
a platform for telling the Enron story, this would be a good one.  If
they can't do it, hopefully we could convince you to do it.  Again, the
date is March 28, 2001.       


The second proposal is to develop a teaching case on Enron along the same
lines.  In fact, if we started working on the teaching case soon, it
could become the basis for the March conference live case study
presentation.  We believe that Enron is unique in its ability to
literally create new markets.  The question is how do you lead and manage
an organization to keep the tight financial and risk controls in place
that you do, but still create the entrepreneurial behavior that seems to
be the case at Enron.  What kind of management philosophies, systems and
practices make this possible.


I know that Enron was the subject of two Harvard cases in 1993 and around
1997.  As I understand it neither focused on organizational and
leadership issues.  We would like to devote a small research team to
building this case about Enron, directed by myself and Professor Lee Dyer
from the ILR School.  We would need access to a number of people in the
Enron organization, but are very aware of the demands on time for fast
moving organizations and are committed to doing this in a very efficient
way.


Kevin, we appreciate your willingness to entertain these two ideas and
hopefully test them with your top leaders.  We will do anything we can to
make it feasible for Enron to engage with us on these two initiatives. 
Please let me know what I can do to help you carry this forward.  As
always, thanks for your great personal support.

EFFICIENCY NEWS

New Proposed Air Conditioner, Heat Pump Standards Fall Short

The new air conditioner energy efficiency standards proposed by the U.S.
Department of Energy fall short of what's justified and what's needed to
lighten the load on electricity demand, says the Alliance to Save Energy. In
a humorous ad campaign developed by the Appliance Standards Awareness
project and featuring Energy Secretary Bill Richardson in digitally-inserted
sunglasses, energy efficiency advocates, urge strong air conditioner
standards. Air conditioners are the largest single contributors to peak
electricity demand - an issue the past two summers as peak demands created
and threatened blackouts and brownouts in various locations. This proposed
legislation is currently in a 60-day public comment period, allowing for
input from interested parties, after which the DOE will issue the final
rule.

Winter Fuel Outlook Bleak, EIA Reveals in New Report

The U.S. Energy Information Administration predicts that natural gas prices
will increase by as much as 40 to 50 percent for consumers this winter over
last winter, or an average of $240 per consumer home, in its Winter Fuels
Outlook, released on October 6. Home heating oil prices are expected to rise
by $190 per home from last year's already high prices in the Northeast,
while electricity prices could increase by as much as 12 percent.
Predictions are based on normal winter weather, and prices could escalate
even further should the weather prove to be colder than normal.

--------------------------------

Gains Expected in Federal Budget for Energy Efficiency Programs

Holding a strong hand due to concerns over sharply rising energy prices and
low winter natural gas and heating oil inventories, and backed by a strong
lobbying effort from the Alliance to Save Energy  and others, the Clinton
administration is expected to win substantial gains for energy efficiency
programs in recently concluded negotiations with Congressional appropriators
over the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection
Agency budget. A total of $814 million is being appropriated for energy
efficiency research, development and deployment programs, run by the DOE's
Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, in increase of $94
million, or 13 percent over the previous budget.

Avoid Home Energy $ticker $hock

If you thought it was expensive to pay up to $2 a gallon for gas this
summer, you'll have continued ""$ticker $hock"" when your home energy bills
arrive this winter with predicted increases. How to avoid it -- check out

Energy Heats Up Election

Each presidential candidate stated his energy policy in the first
presidential debate in Boston, MA, on October 3. Vice President Al Gore's
plan focuses on increasing supply and decreasing demand, while Texas
Governor George W. Bush's plan emphasizes developing domestic energy
supplies. The vice presidential candidates faced off in Danville, KY on
October 5, both echoing the positions of their presidential running mates.

California, New York Make Dramatic Boosts for Energy-Efficiency Funding

In California, bills signed by Governor Gray Davis last week re-assert
California's leadership status on support for energy efficiency and other
clean energy sources. Two bills extend California's system benefits charge
through 2012, while adding an inflation adjustment, creating more than $5
billion of investment in clean energy from 2002-2012. This may be the
largest clean energy fund ever created. A third major bill will speed the
adoption of cost-effective buildings and appliance standards. These measures
are expected to maximize peak energy savings for the summer of 2001, and to
lessen future energy reliability problems.

ed.html

And in Los Angeles, the City Council approved a 10-year power plan that will
meet roughly half of the 1000 megawatts of new power capacity with renewable
energy sources, distributed generation, and demand side management.

http://www.ase.org/e-FFICIENCY/losangeles.htm

The New York State Public Service Commission has proposed increasing the
state's System Benefits Charge from its current $78 million to $139 million
per year, and extending it for five years. About 70 percent of the current
$78 million is used for energy efficiency programs. If this formula holds,
efficiency funding would increase to about $97 million - an 80 percent
increase from current levels. Energy advocates are seeking SBC funding
closer to the $200 million level.

Living Efficiently and Affordably

The U.S. Department of Energy has partnered with the housing industry
through the Building American Program to build affordable, highly
energy-efficient homes throughout the U.S. The Fairburn Commons complex in
an Atlanta suburb opened with 33 units, each of which will cost less than
$1/day to heat and cool.

http://www.doe.gov/news/releases00/seppr/pr00240.htm


Meanwhile, the National Affordable Housing Network released a report on new
energy-efficient, affordable homes built in Texas. Built in partnership with
Habitat for Humanity International, these 40 homes use up to 42 percent less
energy than an average new home. Reduced monthly energy bills are
particularly critical for low-income residents.

Ken,
  Thank you so very much for thinking of this idea.  It is so timely and
certainly fits with Kirbyjon's challenge. I have spoken with Hardie (who
also edited this letter for me) and we both agree that this would have much
greater impact if it came directly from you, as a past Father of the Year.
As you can see we attributed the information about our shortfall directly
to me, so I am involved in the letter but not doing the solicitation.  If
you are not comfortable with this, just let me know and I will redo the
letter.  I think if you agree to send this out over your signature it would
be enormously helpful.  Please let me know what you'd like me to do.

  Thank you again for your thoughtfulness and continuous support.

Re George W. Bush Debate Win/Al Gore's Lies

I hope you got a chance to see the debate last night.  George W. Bush did a
very good job articulating his message and debating Al Gore.

I am sure it will come as no surprise to you that Al Gore could not go the
entire debate without telling a lie.  In fact, two lies have been exposed so
far.

The first one was Gore's claim that he visited Texas with FEMA Director,
James Lee Witt, after the bad Texas floods and tornadoes.  As it turns out,
that was a lie.  Al Gore on the morning news shows today claimed that he
thought he had, but it must have been another state.  Go figure.

The next lie exposed is as follows:

News radio 970 WFLA interviewed the principal of Sarasota High this morning.
He said that the girl that Gore was talking about had no desk for exactly
one day.  It was the first day of class and they were still making
adjustments to the kids class schedule and that particular classroom was
being refurbished.  The teacher only had to call the office and get her a
desk because they have plenty of desks there.  Apparently there is a picture
that was sent to Gore of her standing in class or something like that
because the Principal mentions that in the picture of her there is $100,000
of new equipment behind her.

Please pass this along to your friends and family and any undecided voters.
The more people who realize that Al Gore is a pathological liar, the better
George W. Bush will do.

Please check out the two links and cast your vote for George W. Bush as the
winner in last night's debate:  http://news.excite.com/news/poll/ or
http://www.cnn.com/

Last but not least....Have you done everything you can do to elect George W.
Bush?  Have you made a small contribution to Victory 2000?  Have you
participated in a literature drop for the GOP Ticket or made phone calls on
its behalf?  If not, please let me know.

Thanks for your support.

Mr. Lay--

During the negotiations with the Rockets as to how much each party would
contribute to the Arena referendum campaign, Mike Goldberg of Baker & Botts
suggested that the Rockets would like to net their contribution obligation
against other contributions that they solicited.

After a conversation with you, John Watson and I advised Mike Goldberg that
you did not want to be competing with the Rockets in soliciting
contributions to the Arena referendum campaign.

Mike Goldberg called Friday and asked whether it would be acceptable for the
Rockets to net against their contribution obligation contributions that they
have solicited from Baker & Botts, Jim MacInvale and Tilman Fertitta.  Mike
suggested that these three persons would be the only outside persons that
would be solicited by the Rockets.

Would you please let me know if this is acceptable to you.  You or Rosalee
may call me at 713-758-2350 or send me a response e-mail at
mtelle@velaw.com.

Sincerely,

Michael S. Telle

We have confirmed a meeting to introduce you to Tom Young, EVP (and member, 
O-I Board of Directors) and members of his management team at O-I 
Headquarters next Tuesday, 8/15 at 11:30 am.  We have 90 minutes, Mr. Young 
will be hosting us to lunch during our meeting.  Joe Lemieux, CEO, is 
unavailable only because his calendar just didn't match up with your near 
term available dates.  My strong bias is that the sooner we have an 
opportunity to connect at the top the better, especially given our drive to 
close in Q-3.

In addition to coordinating logistics, I will get briefing packets to your

(details are not likely to come up during the meeting), key O-I personnel 
bios, and general information about O-I and its current business, including 
summary outside financial analysis.

I am writing to confirm our discussion of yesterday afternoon.  After we
spoke, I conferred with John Watson who, like me, believed that we were
going to use terms of the Enron Field financing for the Arena, with a few
minor changes that we had discussed.  The term sheet that we originally
provided you during the summer reflected that arrangement.  We have
discussed that term sheet with the partners, believing it to be the deal,
and they have approved the garage loan on those terms.

John and I believe that the comments on the term sheet that you, James
Hernandez and Mike Bartolotta have provided us recently constitute a
significant departure from the Enron Field deal.  Although we understand the
arguments each of you have made in favor of such comments, these comments
nonetheless will need to be evaluated by a business representative from the
partnership and approved by the partnership.  I recommend that we schedule a
meeting next week so that we can discuss these issues and try to resolve
them.

Finally, John was disappointed to hear that the HCHSA will be unwilling to
prepay the $1.4 million amount needed by the referendum.  Because we
understand that the referendum campaign is in dire need of funding, we hope
that you might reconsider your decision not to prepay the $1.4 million until
after we have finalized the term sheet.

I will be unavailable for a great deal of the day today, but I will have
time to meet next week.  Please let me know when we might be able to get
together to discuss the term sheet.

From:         Lou Cordia
Date:         November 13, 2000
Re:            President Bush or President Gore?

Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney won on election night by getting
more votes in Florida than Gore/Lieberman.

Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney won when the election night vote
was confirmed by an official recount in Florida.

The only legitimate remaining ballots to be counted are those from Floridians
who reside overseas, who post-marked their ballots on or before November 7th,
and whose ballots are received on or before November 17th.

However, it is obvious that Gore/Lieberman are trying to steal the election.
Like the Clinton/Gore's years of public relations and legal distortions, 
Gore/Lieberman
are looking for a ""governing legal authority"" to increase their probability 
of victory.
They want four counties in Florida where Democrats significantly out-register 
Republicans
to hand-count their ballots; and let the Democrats in charge of the recounts 
""objectively""
decide what was in the mind of the voter when he/she did not completely punch 
the ballot.
For example, if someone partially punched a hole in a ballot because he/she 
started to vote
for Gore and then decided in the booth not to vote him or anyone, these 
Democrats would
give the vote to Gore - that's according to the second set of rules, as 
changed during the
recount in Palm Beach County.  Incidently, but not surprisingly, all three of 
these Palm
Beach officials are Democrats.

What Gore/Lieberman Campaign Chairman Richard Daley is orchestrating is as 
outrageous
as what his father did in 1960 in Cook County Illinois in stealing the 
election from John Kennedy.

Point blank, Al Gore is not as honorable as Richard Nixon was in 1960 and 
Gerald Ford was
in 1976 when both Republican candidates conceded the close elections despite 
campaign
advisors' requests for recounts.  They put the interests of the country ahead 
of their own
personal interest in the White House.  They knew then that recounting ad 
infinitum would
produce pluses and minuses in vote counts; but they trusted that the votes 
would balance
out if all precincts were recounted.  They believed in the integrity of our 
elections, and knew
of the adverse consequences here and abroad of second-guessing our election 
process.

If you are as upset as I am, then please help by making a contribution to the 
Bush/Cheney
Recount Fund that has been set up to fight the Gore/Lieberman trial lawyers 
and public
relations spin- miesters.

I am enclosing an admittedly less emotionally-charged letter from Bush/Cheney 
Campaign
Chairman Don Evans and a response form.  Please HELP TODAY.

           Chairman, Bush-Cheney Campaign

Date:  November 11, 2000

You were there when we began this campaign and we appreciate all that you have
done.  I would like to ask for your help one more time on behalf of Governor 
Bush
and Secretary Cheney.

It is now clear we must have the funding necessary to fight this legal battle 
in Florida.
Governor Bush won on Election Day, a victory confirmed by a recount.  Now, 
the other
side is seeking yet a third count by hand.

The law allows us to open a ""recount fund"" which we have done this morning.  
This
expensive legal process must be funded immediately.  We need you to overnight 
a check
for $5000, made payable to Bush-Cheney Recount.  Please see the delivery 
instructions
on the next page.

The check must come from personal funds.  No corporate contributions are 
allowed.
The contribution does not count against your annual federal giving limit of 
$25,000.
We are not required to make these donations public.  However, in keeping with 
Governor
Bush's ""full disclosure"" policy on financial contributions, these 
contributions will be posted
on the Bush-Cheney website.

We respectfully ask that you limit the amount of your check to $5000.  Should 
we have
funds left over, we will refund them to each donor on a pro rata basis.  If 
you have any
questions regarding this contribution, you may contact Jack Oliver or Jeanne 
Johnson
Phillips at (512) 344-4601.

Throughout the past two years, your friendship and support has meant a great 
deal to
Governor Bush and to me personally.  We thank you in advance for your 
willingness to
help us during this important time in the life of our country.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Warm regards.

Subject: rockets season has begun


Hello dear siblings... yes, believe it or not, I  am sending one of my rare 
e-mails.?
?
I will be in charge of distributing Rocket  tickets this season for mom and 
Ken?since I successfully accomplished  baseball ticket distribution without 
having a nervous breakdown.? You all  were actually wonderful and made it 
very easy due to the rules that were set  up by the folks prior to my 
receiving that responsibility.? Organization  comes natural to me so I am 
happy to do it again so that mom has one less  thing on her plate.
?
Rules have not yet been sent out by mom and  Ken,?but I do want to get a jump 
start on the season distribution since  it is upon us already.? With 
baseball, all ticket were requested prior to  the 1st of each month, so that 
I was able to commit game tickets to family and  then to Mom and Ken's 
significant other people for that  given?month.? Tickets were requested and 
guaranteed one  month?at a time?not further out?than that.? There was also  
some sort of first come first serve rule?which I don't fully remember but  it 
also never became a problem.??All of these rules made it  work?so I suggest 
sticking to them  again?regarding?basketball.??(Mom and Ken?may null  and 
void all of this with new rules but these are my suggestions until they do  
so.)
?
There are 4 tickets grouped together on row 1 and  an additional 4 tickets 
grouped together on row 2.? So, this year we have  the pleasure of an 
additional 4 tickets at each game which should make the  rubics cube of 
ticket distribution a bit easier.
?
November games include:
?
Thursday??? ???  Nov.2?????? ?? 7:30  pm??? Milwaukee
Tuesday??? ???  ?Nov.7???????? 7:30  pm??? Los Angeles
Thursday??? ???  Nov.9?????? ?? 7:30  pm??? Vancover
Tuesday????  ??? Nov.14????????7:30  pm????Chicago
Thursday??????  Nov.16??? ??? 7:30 pm???  Charlotte
Saturday??? ???  Nov.18??? ??? 7:30 pm???  Pheonix
Tuesday??????  ? Nov. 28???????7:30  pm??? Sacramento
?
Please let me know ASAP what your requests are  for the month of November and 
I will do my best to try and make everyone  happy.? This needs to be resolved 
by friday of this week  Nov.3rd so that I am able to distribute to family and 
then start  making calls down the list of mom and Ken's significant other 
people so that  all tickets are used.? If you have not contacted me by friday 
with your  requests, I will distribute tickets so no whining is allowed if 
you don't get  what you later realize you want.? Remember FRIDAY IS THE 
DEADLINE FOR THE  MONTH OF NOVEMBER.
?
Regarding December, get your requests in now  which will be final and tickets 
will be distributed to everyone by  friday the?1st of December.
No tickets will go unused.
?
December games include:
?
Saturday??? ??? Dec  2??????????7:30  pm??? Portland
Tuesday???  ???? Dec  5??????????7:30  pm??? Dallas
Saturday??? ??? Dec  16??? ??? 7:30 pm???  Denver
Tuesday???????  ?Dec 19??? ??? 7:30 pm???  San Antonio
Thursday??? ??? Dec  21??? ??? 7:30 pm??? Los  Angeles
Saturday??? ??? Dec  23??? ??? 7:30 pm??? Golden  State
Wednesday???Dec  27??? ??? 7:30 pm???  Seattle
?
Best way to get me is by fax 713 629  5755 since I am at home with the wee 
precious ones.? I receive  faxes?instantly.? For those of you that are hipper 
than me and like  email, that is another option but?it takes a maximum?of 24 
hours for  me to receive your messages since Christophe takes the computer to 
and from  work everyday.
?
I hope everyone is doing well and HAPPY  HALLOWEEN!!!

Subject: President And Congress To Meet In Attempt To Resolve Budget 
Disagreement

President Clinton vetoed the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill 
yesterday. His press secretary announced that other vetoes were possible 
until the President and Congress reached agreement on the budget impasse. The 
Defense Appropriation conference report which contains authority to 
permanently extend the exemption relating to OPIC and ExIm financing for 
projects in India is in the cue and could be affected by this action. 

Congressional authority for government operations expires this week as does 
the one-year exemption. Congress must act by Thursday to extend both items. 
Congress is expected to adopt a ""continuing resolution"" through October 29 
while the two branches of government work out their differences.

The President and Congressional leaders are to meet today to discuss and 
possibly establish a procedure for negotating the disagreement.

We plan to distribute the final draft by mid-March in time for you to take
one last careful look before a conference call at the end of the month, and
also for you to submit any supplementary views for inclusion. My suggestion
is that views be kept to a few paragraphs, if possible. For those who wish
to write one, you could disagree with part of the report, you could suggest
a slightly different emphasis on some aspect of the report, or you could
underline some aspect that you are especially enthusiastic about and believe
deserves more attention.

When we send the next draft to you I'll try to propose something about how
we might release the report, but I would appreciate any suggestions you have
about that.

Here are two proposed dates for our next conference call. Please indicate
your availability by preference (#1, #2).

(#2) Wednesday, March 28, 5-6:30 PM
     (Eastern Standard Time)

(#1) Thursday, March 29, 5-6:30 PM
     (Eastern Standard Time)

Could you also send us the precise way that you would like your name and
title to appear in the report?

Many thanks,

Jeff Garten

The reason Ken and Linda were trying to reach you from the plane was that 
they had some suggestions for the hotel rooms and wanted you to know their 
preference.  They would like to give the Jasmine Suite that they are 
currently in to the Vittors with a connecting bedroom, to take care of their 
family.

They would like Mark and Natalie to have the end or corner suite that the 
Vittors have.

Ken and Linda said that they would prefer two connecting rooms, hopefully on 
the 3rd or 4th floor.  They would like for the rooms to have the ocean view 
on the North side.  If that isn't possible, it would be o.k. to overlook the 
pool, but they would not really like the south side as it wouldn't be as 
quiet.  The two rooms would give them everything they need, with 2 baths.

They said they can be reached in Switzerland tomorrow.  The Hotel Meierhof's 
phone number is:  41-81-416-82-85, Fax is:  41-81-416-39-82.  They should 
arrive in Davos about 9:00 a.m.

I know you will have a beautiful and wonderful wedding!!  Thank you so much 
for including me on the Save the Date list.  I feel honored!  Unfortunately, 
we won't be able to come.   Our ""first"" anniversary is June 3, but was 1961!!

> >  saw him preach at the small summer church, St. Ann's by the Sea. We all

He

> >  I don't remember the exact words. It was more the power of his example.
> > The

> >  day we  walked and talked at Walker's Point, and I knew I was in the
> >  presence of a great man. He was like a magnet; I felt drawn to

> > warmth
> >  and concern. Billy Graham didn't make you feel guilty; he made you feel

> >  Over the course of that weekend, Reverend Graham planted a mustard seed
> > in
> >  my soul, a seed that grew over the next year. He led me to the path,
and
> > I
> >  began walking. It was the beginning of a change in my life. I had
always

> >  Sunday School and served as an altar boy. But that weekend my faith
took
> > on
> >  a new meaning. It was the beginning of a new walk where I would commit
> > my
> >  heart to Jesus Christ. I was humbled to learn that God sent His Son to
> > die
> >  for a sinner like me. I was comforted to know that through the Son, I
> > could
> > find God's amazing grace, a grace that crosses every border, every

> >  and is open to everyone. Through the love of Christ's life, I could
> >  understand the life changing powers of faith. When I returned to
> > Midland, I
> >  began reading the Bible regularly. Don Evans  talked me into joining
him
> >  and another friend, Don Jones, at a men's community Bible study. The
> > group
> >  had first assembled the year before, in Spring of 1984, at the
beginning
> > of
> >  the downturn in the energy industry. Midland was hurting. A lot of
> > people
> >  were looking for comfort and strength and direction. A couple of men
> >  started the Bible study as a support group, and it grew. By the time I
> >  began attending, in the fall of 1985, almost 120 men would gather. We
> > met
> >  in small discussion groups of ten or twelve, then joined the larger
> > group
> >  for full meetings. Don Jones picked me up every week for the meetings.
I
> >  remember
> >  looking forward to them. My interest in reading the Bible grew stronger
> > and
> >  stronger, and the words became clearer and more meaningful. We studied
> >  Acts, the story of the Apostles building the Christian Church, and next
> >  year, the Gospel of Luke. The preparation for each meeting took several
> >  hours, reading the Scripture passages and thinking through responses to
> >  discussion questions. I took it seriously, with my usual touch of
> > humor....
> >
> >  Laura and I were active members of the First Methodist Church of
> > Midland,
> >  and we participated in many family programs, including James Dobson's
> > Focus
> >  on the Family series on raising children. As I studied and learned,
> >  Scripture took on greater meaning, and gained confidence and
> > understanding
> >  in my faith. I read the Bible regularly. Don Evans gave me the
> > ""one-year""
> >  Bible, a Bible divided into 365 daily readings, each one including a
> >  section from the New Testament, the Old Testament, Psalms, and
Proverbs.
> > I
> >  read through that Bible every other year.
> >
> >  During the years in between, I pick different chapters to study at
> >  different times. I have also learned the power of prayer. I pray for
> >  guidance. I do not pray for earthly things, but for heavenly things,
for
> >  wisdom and patience and understanding. My faith gives me focus and
> >  perspective. It teaches humility. But I also recognize that faith can
be
> >  misinterpreted in the political process. Faith is an important part of
> > my
> >  life. I believe it is important so I live my faith, not flaunt it.
> > America

for

> >  Thanksgiving with our daughter, who was attending a school program
> > there,
> >  and spent three days in Israel on the way home. It was an incredible
> >  experience. I remember waking up at the Jerusalem Hilton and opening
the
> >  curtains and seeing the Old City before us, the Jerusalem stone glowing
> >  gold. We visited the Western Wall and the Church of the Holy Sepulcher.
> > And
> >  we went to the Sea of Galilee and stood atop the hill  where Jesus
> >  delivered the Sermon on the Mount. It was an overwhelming feeling to

> >  in the spot where the most famous

> > and
> >  the world the beatitudes, the golden rule, and the Lord's Prayer.  Our

Catholics,
> >  and a Mormon, and several Jewish-American friends. Someone suggested we

Later

1537,<31144620.1075840224719.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Mon, 20 Nov 2000 09:14:00 -0800 (PST)",peter.weidler@enron.com,,Argentine devaluation exposure,"Attached is an analysis of the probability of a devaluation in Argentina and 
the contractual protections TGS has in the event of a devaluation.  

Long and short of it is - 

Argentina's economy is primarily dollarized and it would appear that a 
devaluation would do considerable short term harm to the economy. 

Convertibility Law was enacted in 1991.  Large part of the population 
remembers the super inflation of 1989 and 1990.

To devalue the currency, Argentina would have to amend the Convertibility Law 
- this requires  approval of the Federal Congress.

TGS has numerous layers of protection from a devaluation - in addition to the 
Convertibility law, it has protection through its license and regulations.  
Indeed, as you remembered, the tariff is indexed to the exchange rate.

A concern is - to the extent the Government takes action as drastic as 
changing the Convertibility Law to implement a devaluation, and it is willing 
to suffer the short term economic and political harm of a devaluation - then 
there is a reasonable chance they would go the extra step and find a way 
delink the tariffs of the privatized regulated companies from the dollar.    
In this case Enron would have protection under the BIT treaty.

The impact on Enron's P&L is a function of whether or not we use the Peso as 
the functional currency.  If we use the Peso as the functional currency - 
Enron would have a signficant negative translation adjustment from a 
devaluation.  If we use the dollar as the functional currency - there would 
be no impact on our income statement.   I will research this further in order 
to ensure we can use the dollar as a our functional currency.

The rumors have been very active throughout this process and people in this 
office have been aware of the various candidates. I have gained 98 percent of 
my information from my office collegues. I have not been discussing any of 
these matters with outsiders suggesting that they contact Nils for any 
information.

Naturally, I am concerned how this announcement is to be made because I am 
hoping to have a life after Enron possibly a position in a future 
administration. I have had a very successful tenure from the standpoint of 
accomplishments and establishing the groundwork for additional success which 
my successor will have the benefit. Therefore, I want a very positive 
statement made about my service with a Ken Lay quote.

ISSUES IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY
November 2000, Number 11


CRITICAL ASPECTS OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY
Sidney Weintraub

When the word ""globalization"" is uttered, it evokes two contradictory 
visceral reactions: it is either the essential element of recent U.S. 
competitiveness; or it is inherently evil because the global spread of 
multinational corporations enriches the wealthy and economically powerful at 
the expense of the vast multitude of workers. In what follows, I will avoid 
both attacks and praise, and instead focus on key features of international 
trade and investment that characterize what is taking place in much of the 
world.

A country, if its dictatorial leader so insists, can set its own prohibitive 
tariff and import structure and reject foreign investment. North Korea and 
Vietnam, both nondemocratic, did this for many years, despite the horrible 
cost this policy imposed on national welfare. This isolation is breaking down 
in these two countries, even as it did earlier in China after the death of 
Mao, and for much the same reason. Eternal poverty is not a good formula for 
regime continuity.

Guarding economic sovereignty did not take the same absolutist form in most 
other countries, but a profound transformation is taking place in them as 
well. Import barriers are coming down and attacks against foreign investment 
are being transmuted into searches to attract foreign investment. Mexico, 
before its debt collapse in 1982, favored external borrowing over investment 
to obtain foreign exchange, but learned to its dismay that this practice 
contained its own risks when the debt could not be serviced. The philosophic 
base of development then changed and foreign investment was actively sought 
as an essential requirement for Mexico to augment its exports. This outlook 
was the premise of NAFTA. Hugo Ch?vez, the president of Venezuela, rails 
against primitive neoliberalism (neoliberalismo salvaje), but nevertheless 
has kept the country's import tariffs relatively low, even as he makes a 
great effort to obtain foreign direct investment to develop his country's 
telecommunications and natural gas activities. Ch?vez, so far, has shown a 
tendency to talk like a Marxist, much like Fidel Castro, his romantic icon, 
but then act like a capitalist.

For many of the world's poorest countries, the primordial problem is not the 
spread of multinational corporations, but their inability to participate in 
the process. This is especially true in sub-Saharan Africa. Their poverty, 
small internal markets, and accompanying political instability make them poor 
destinations for foreign investment, other than to exploit minerals for 
export. This does not lead to substantial job creation.

Both foreign direct investment and international trade are growing more 
rapidly than world economic growth. This is a clear manifestation that the 
""foreign"" aspect of the world economy is becoming increasingly important. If 
one looks back only 20 years, when the dominant economic model in Latin 
America was to develop behind high import barriers and to downplay the 
importance of exports, it is startling how much development thinking has 
changed in that part of the world. East Asia, with its export orientation, 
became the model, and not the preachings of those who advised Latin America 
to look inward.

The bulk of the world's trade is carried on by large corporations. This is 
not a new phenomenon. These same corporations are large investors in foreign 
manufacturing and service activities. Indeed, the two phenomena-investing and 
producing in foreign countries and then selling much of the output in still 
other foreign countries, as well as the home market-are inseparable.

International trade is increasingly taking place in intermediate rather than 
final products-chips for computers, parts for office machinery, engines for 
automobiles and trucks, cotton and wool fabrics for apparel. Look under the 
hood of your car; the transmission assembly may have elements produced in a 
number of countries. The assembly line in Detroit works on a just-in-time 
basis to receive the material needed from across the border in Windsor, 
Ontario-and beware of a slowdown from a customs snafu that leads to a costly 
disruption in the manufacturing process.

This goes by the name coproduction. The parts are produced in a variety of 
locations, assembled in other places, and sold globally. Much of the sales 
are within the same multinational corporation, say, from a parent to a 
subsidiary (intra-firm trade), or within the same sector (intra-industry 
trade). As goods pass across borders in this fashion, the absence of border 
impediments (tariffs, lengthy inspection delays) is crucial, as the 
automotive example between Windsor and Detroit exemplifies. Hence, the drive 
for trade negotiations to lower these barriers and the proliferation of 
regional economic integration agreements, such as NAFTA, to legally ensure 
the absence of delays in a just-in-time world.

Economic integration and, by extension, the process of globalization, is 
centered on competition in particular sectors when it comes to production and 
merchandise trade. What is taking place is a form of division of labor-Adam 
Smith on a regional and global scale. The global aspect is made possible by 
technology, advances in communication and transportation, and by financing 
far more vast than anything seen before. Corporations take many factors into 
account when setting up complementary plants in foreign countries, such as 
size of the domestic market, the availability and price of labor, the cost of 
transportation, and the political stability of the country where the 
investment is made. The growth of U.S. coproduction with Mexico was based 
primarily on two considerations: proximity, and thus low transportation 
costs; and inexpensive labor. Most foreign direct investment is made among 
industrial countries, which is evidence that cheap labor is by no means 
always the dominant criterion. This is evident as well from the paucity of 
investment in the world's poorest countries.

If most international trade is conducted by large corporations, what does 
this imply for the future of small and medium-sized enterprises? In just 
about all countries, goods and services that are not internationally traded 
are more voluminous than tradables. In addition, many large corporations have 
concluded that making all inputs in-house is not the most efficient practice 
and instead are subcontracting to independent producers and service 
providers-and many of these are relatively small enterprises. Their products 
are then exported indirectly, via the exports of the large corporations.

There is no intent in this discussion to assert that multinational 
corporations invariably provide their workers with optimal working conditions 
and good salaries and are always careful to avoid environmental degradation 
in their operations. We know that many corporations are not that meticulous, 
even though we also know that wages and working conditions in foreign 
transplants generally are superior to those of domestic enterprises. We know 
that foreign trade and investment results in losers in the home countries, 
although by now it is clear that there are many more winners. We know that 
the global spread of business benefits some countries more than others and 
that some regions of countries prosper while others lag behind. The 
globalization genie-in the form of investment, trade, financial flows, and 
technology advances-is out of the bottle. The challenges are to minimize the 
downside dangers while exploiting the upside benefits that globalization can 
offer to countries throughout the world.

I understand that Enron has just terminated
negotiations with regard to leasing some 1.5 million
sq.ft. of space at Canary Wharf in London.

I would like you to consider the London Dome. This has
sufficient space for all your needs, would provide a
high profile location, and I can put together a

Just wanted to give you some more to think about. What
I would really like to find is a job that combines my
interest in politics, my legislative skills, with my
passion for marine conservation.  This can expand to
environmental conservation.

The number one corporate target for me is the
Discovery Channel in Miami. They do have a fairly
significant office there and I am going to try and
make contacts at Discovery.

One option I am considering is working on the Bush
campaign from now until November in hopes during that
time I will make contacts in South Florida.
Unfortunately, they are not doing a significant amount
of work in South Florida.

I'll be around this weekend and would appreciate any
input.
I love you!
Elizabeth

Global Sourcing, and members of his sourcing group.  As you remember, we 
first met Kent when Tom White, Dan Leff, Harold Buchanan and I called on him 
two years ago.  At the time, we presented an early version of a fully bundled 
energy outsource in partnership with Fluor Daniel and a local real estate 
management firm.

Over the last two years, UTC attempted various energy procurement strategies, 
failing to execute any.  

Brittan was very pleased with the content of our revised proposal yesterday, 
and told us he would be taking the revised partnership strategy we discussed 
directly to George David, CEO.  

Brittan will also be taking the preliminary concept to UTC Corporate 
Treasury, to gain its buy in on the financing aspects of the deal required to 
support the demand side management infrastructure investments it so 
desperately needs to affect the energy  consumption reduction to which David 
committed two years ago.

Barring a problem there, it appears we have finally engaged UTC in an 
exclusive negotiating relationship that would yield a large scale outsource 
of energy supply and demand side investment operations in all the UTC 
companies, excepting Carrier.    Carrier continues to insist it be treated 
separately, and Brittan has decided to carve it out, rather than hold up the 
entire deal.  I think that strategy is part of what he will be speaking to 
David about.

I requested, and Brittan agreed, that Karl Kropic (COO) be the executive 
sponsor.

Mike Jackson who has worked on and off with UTC over the past 18 months will 
be the lead Originator for EES moving forward.",LAY-K

In light of Jesse Greene's acceptance of the SVP, Strategy position, we have
re-examined his option opportunity for 2001.  As you recall, we deferred a
decision on his option grant in December 2000 pending a decision on his
status.

Now that Jesse has accepted this new role, we are recommending a grant of
125,000 stock options, which is comparable to the December 2000 grant to
other 16b officers in staff positions.  As a point of reference, below are
the option grants made to 16b officers in December 2000:

Blackmore - 375k
Winkler - 350k
Larson - 275k
McDowell - 250k
Elias - 150k
Jackson - 175k
Siekman - 155k

Materials have been sent to the contacts you made for TFA in LA. Beyond that
I have been focused recently on finalizing the TFA relationships with
Smartforce and IverCity.Com.  We will announce the Smartforce donation (450K
eLearning scholarships over three years) at a meeting in Boston on November
15.  This is a huge gift ($30-$45 million in retail value).  I have been in
contact (phone and face to face visits) with several nonprofit groups in LA
involved in local initiatives there.  Some of these groups are working
together and some are not.  15,000 ($1.5 million in value) of the Smartforce
eLearning courses are reserved for LA and could be utilized by local groups
there if they can work together. It is my hope that TFA can help encourage
that. One of the issues, of course, is identifying other potential
co-branding corporations/foundations that can help bring the necessary
dollars to the table. In-kind donations have been relatively easy to
accumulate. Finding the necessary cash is more difficult. I do agree with
you that Mayor Riordan's future plans could be good for TFA.  Perhaps we can
talk by phone in the next day or two to follow through on some of our
previous discussions.  I will be in Washington DC later in the week to meet
with the Internet Policy Institute, the Pew Foundation and others.


I have also been following through on some contacts in DC and New York City.
Again, we will need co-branding relationships with $'s and in-kind resources
to make this work.

News from Los Angeles in the Los Angeles Times
Riordan to Join L.A. Unified After He Leaves City Hall
 <<...>> Mayor: In an address to Valley leaders, he strongly denounces
secession, then makes surprising disclosure about plan to take executive
post with district.
By JIM NEWTON, Times Staff Writer


In his final annual address on the state of the San Fernando Valley, Los
Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan on Friday delivered his most forceful call
ever for that area to remain part of the larger city, then surprised the
audience by announcing that he will go to work for the Los Angeles
Unified School District when he finishes his term in office.
Speaking to a group of Valley business leaders, Riordan denounced
secession on political, moral and practical grounds, warning that it
would force a tax hike, leave the Valley with uncertain leadership and
abandon the city's poor.
""I love the Valley,"" Riordan said. ""I feel that you're part of the
family, and I don't want you to desert the family. . . . The rest of the
city needs you. You can't abandon the poor. It just isn't right.""
Riordan's pointed rejection of secession represents a significant
escalation in his efforts to head off that politically charged
prospect--a topic so heated that in a mayoral debate following Riordan's
speech, not one of the six candidates angling for election in April so
much as mentioned the word. Riordan, by contrast, tackled the issue
head-on and in far more confrontational terms than he ever has before.
""Secession,"" Riordan said bluntly, ""is a lousy idea.""
As significant as that pronouncement was, however, the mayor almost
overshadowed it with an offhand personal remark in response to a
question after his speech. Asked to elaborate on his thoughts about
breaking up the school district, Riordan let slip that he intends to go
to work for L.A. Unified after he finishes his second term as mayor,
which ends next summer.
The mayor, who helped elect four of the school board's seven members,
said he has been in discussions with Supt. Roy Romer and has agreed to
accept an ""executive position"" with the district next year. Riordan did
not elaborate, but in an interview later, he said he and the
superintendent had agreed that Riordan would run the district's
classroom computer program.
The former Colorado governor, who now runs the city's schools, was not
immediately available for comment.
At the district, Riordan said, he will be in charge of working with
schools to make effective use of computers in the classroom. Riordan,
who has donated thousands of computers to schools in various parts of
the country, said the job fit his talents. ""I think this is something
I'm good at,"" he said. ""I know the experts in the field.""
Riordan's post-mayoral plans have for months been the object of much
speculation. Most observers predicted he would do something in the field
of education, because no topic animates Riordan as much as children and
schools.
But Riordan is a multimillionaire, and he will be over 70 when he
finishes his second term as mayor. He passed up the chance to run for
governor in 1998, and some friends had predicted he would slow down when
he wrapped up his mayoral administration.
The idea of a quiet retirement, however, seems to have little appeal for
Riordan, an energetic and restless man. Asked how long he intended to
take off between finishing his work as mayor and starting his new job at
the school district, Riordan responded: ""three or four hours.""
Riordan has held office for nearly eight years, and for that entire time
has enjoyed the strong support of the San Fernando Valley. It was the
Valley that helped put him in office in 1993, and polls since have shown
that though he is popular citywide, he enjoys his greatest approval
ratings north of the Hollywood Hills.
As the race to succeed him gathers steam, some of the candidates clearly
covet Riordan's base in the Valley.
On Friday, City Councilman Joel Wachs often invoked the mayor's name
during a low-energy debate among the six leading mayoral candidates.
Among other things, Wachs praised Riordan's economic development
initiatives and his handling of the recently completed negotiations
between the city and federal government over the future of the Los
Angeles Police Department.
So effusive was Wachs in his praise of Riordan that eventually
businessman Steve Soboroff complained. As Soboroff pointed out to the
audience, Riordan has endorsed his candidacy, not Wachs'. Soboroff
suggested that his rival withdraw from the race and back him instead.
Wachs laughed, but did not respond.
The debate--really more of a panel discussion in which the candidates
rarely addressed one another, while sitting cheek-by-jowl in
straight-backed chairs--also was notable as the first joint appearance
of the candidates to include state Controller Kathleen Connell, the
latest contender to join the race.
Connell used her debut debate performance to stress her determination to
bring tough fiscal management to the problems of Los Angeles. She
addressed issues such as police corruption, transportation and the
city's business climate in terms of their economic impact, arguing that
her experience in the private sector and as controller made her the
right person to handle that task.
In other debate highlights, City Atty. James Hahn and Assemblyman
Antonio Villaraigosa enthusiastically welcomed the signing of the
consent decree with the federal government on police reform.
Connell, Wachs and U.S. Rep. Xavier Becerra also applauded the deal,
though in less glowing terms.
Soboroff was the only candidate to oppose it, calling it an abdication
of local responsibility.

25.06. OPEC ministers have indicated that members have highlighted $25/bbl
as a price that they feel comfortable with.The decreases per country were as

ENERGY AFRICA LOOK TOWARD THE MOROCCAN DEEP
Rabat - This week the MENA Petroleum Bulletin spoke with Andrew Windham,
Group General Counsel for Energy Africa. Amina Benkhadra, General Manager of
ONAREP (25%) added to the growing list of re-entrants to Morocco, signing a
petroleum agreement with Energy Africa (63.75%) and Taurus Petroleum AB
(11.25%). This agreement, taking effect March 1st 2001, concerned three
exploration permits offshore Morocco collectively known as the Tiznit
Offshore area.
Energy Africa Morocco Ltd (operator), together with Taurus Petroleum
(co-partner) will implement exploration work on the three permits of the
Tiznit Offshore area covering approximately 6000sq.km. This is Energy
Africa's second Petroleum Agreement covering acreage offshore Morocco, the
first being the Cap Draa Haute Mer area where Energy Africa holds 20% equity
bringing the total acreage held by it in the country to 18,000sq.km.
Andrew Windham, said, 'the country has all the characteristics offshore
which make potentially, for substantial discoveries. But at this stage it is
very much untried and untested, so it is a very exciting place to be at the
moment. We are in right at the start of some new plays.'
For further details please see the April issue of the MENA Petroleum
Bulletin.


REPSOL MAKE 2ND LIBYA DISCOVERY
London - Repsol YPF SA said it discovered oil at a second well during
exploration in Libya. The well in the Murzuq Basin, 800km south of Tripoli,
produced oil at a rate of 1,300bbl/d, the company said in a press release.
Repsol is testing the site on behalf of a consortium including OMV,
TotalFinaElf and Saga Petroleum. Repsol began searching for oil in the area
in May 1998, when the Libyan government granted approval for exploration and
production sharing arrangements with foreign companies. The companies
currently produce more than 160,000bbl/d from the Murzuq Basin, said the
company.


AHMED ABDELKARIM CONFIRMED AS NEW HEAD OF NOC
Tripoli - Further to reports this week from Libya Ahmed Abdel-Karim Ahmed
has been formally appointed as Chairman of NOC, following reports that he
had been removed from the position. Representing Libya at the OPEC
conference in Geneva it was confirmed that Al-Badri has been appointed as
Deputy Prime Minister for Social Security. The news will comfort foreign
investors who feared that further upheaval would hinder an already slow
ratification process, with approvals outstanding for three packages of
blocks offered by NOC in late 2000.

MENA POWER
23 & 24th April 2001, Crowne Plaza Hotel, Dubai
For further information visit
http://www.smi-online.co.uk/middleeastpower2.asp

The timing of this conference couldn't be better as the Middle East and
North African region gears up to offer further independent power projects.

SMi forthcoming conference titled Middle East North African Power, taking
place 23rd and 24th April 2001 aims to bring together all levels of
participants to explain their understanding and thinking for the future of
Middle East and North African power development.

Many countries experience blackouts and electrical faults on a daily basis,
governments in the Middle East and North Africa are now increasingly pinning
their hopes on the Independent Power Project run in conjunction with major
International investors to solve this problem.   Relaxation of Middle East
law has allowed outside investment and many see this moving the Middle East
power industry towards privatisation.

Key Speakers at this event include:
* Engineer Mahmoud Al-Ees, Head of Planning Studies, Ministry of Energy and
Mineral Resources - Jordan
* Dr Ranald Spiers, Regional Director Middle East & Africa, National Power
Plc
* Steve Wildman, Commercial Director, Alstom Gas Turbines
* Tom Thomason, Project Manager, InterGen
* Daniel J. Meier, Area Sales Manager, ABB High Voltage Technologies
* Dr Thomas Stauffer, International Oil and Finance Consultant (Formerly
with M.I.T)

MENA Power takes place on 23rd & 24th April 2001 at the Crowne Plaza Hotel,
Dubai.  The full conference programme is available at

A review of SMi's Algerian Management Report can be found on:
http://www.smi-online.co.uk/algeria.asp

The Aims & Objectives of the Conference

Algeria has always attracted a large amount of interest from the
international oil and gas community.  With a new licensing round under
discussion and petroleum code under review, this conference aims to act as a
forum for all aspects of the oil and gas industry to come together and
discuss the future development of Algeria's oil and gas sector.  Moving away
from the traditional investing in format of conference, this forum aims to
look at specific field studies and also the future markets and developments
within the Algerian oil and gas industry.  It will focus on the commercial
opportunities that exist in helping Algeria reach these markets and allow
for strategic analysis of the impact of this supplier.  It will examine
current MENA energy flows and how they might look in the future with Algeria
asserting its role as the Mediterranean's major producing nation.

ISSUES IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY
October 2000, Number 10


TELLING IT LIKE IT IS
Sidney Weintraub

This is my curmudgeon commentary. Its barbs are directed against 
exaggeration, double talk, and scapegoating of important institutions engaged 
in global economic development.

I do not intend, in what follows, to disparage the importance of labor unions 
in protecting the rights and benefits of workers, or to argue that the United 
States is a protectionist nation, or to doubt the valuable work that is done 
by multilateral institutions. My purpose, rather, is to highlight a few 
points: the hypocrisy that exists when imports of goods and services from 
poor countries are restricted while simultaneously insisting that this 
exclusion will benefit workers in those countries; the inconsistency of 
promoting democracy in developing countries even as we neglect the interplay 
of foreign trade, economic well-being, and political outcomes; the 
perpetuation of the fiction that multilateral institutions are independent 
actors that behave supranationally in ways that conflict with the desires of 
their powerful members; and the misconception that institutions such as the 
World Bank provide a service by promising more than they can deliver.

The leaders of organized labor in the United States opposed NAFTA and the 
grant of permanent normal trading relations with China. They are also against 
a free trade area of the Americas and opening a new round of negotiations in 
the World Trade Organization. The stated basis for this opposition is that 
the United States should not further liberalize its import structure until 
other countries accept core labor standards (right of association, power to 
organize and bargain collectively, prohibition against forced labor, minimum 
age for employment of children, and acceptable working conditions), and that 
punishment should be meted out in the form of U.S. import restrictions when 
these standards are violated.

Is this protectionism or a socially conscious initiative to upgrade labor 
conditions in poor countries? The leaders of poor countries insist that they, 
too, want to raise labor standards, but cannot do this if their export 
earnings are restricted. The practical result of the U.S. position is that 
meaningful trade negotiations are not going forward. Even though labor 
leaders insist this is not about protectionism, it sure looks like 
protectionism. (Former senator Dale Bumpers has noted that when politicians 
say something is not about money, it is about money.)

World Bank analysis has shown persuasively that the developing countries that 
have made the most progress in raising incomes are those that have opened 
their markets and engaged actively in world trade. However, there are still 
antitrade advocates who advise today's developing countries to look inward, 
just as many of today's developed countries focused first on internal markets 
and protecting their producers against foreign competitors. This was 
Alexander Hamilton's advice to the newborn United States. It was the 
development pattern for Japan. It was Ra?l Prebisch's advice to Latin 
American countries. Although this advice may have had some relevance once 
upon a time for countries with large or potentially large internal markets, 
such as Brazil, it surely does not for countries with tiny markets, like many 
in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Africa. The lesson of post-World War II 
development history is that countries that looked outward, such as those in 
East Asia, grew rapidly, while those that looked inward, as in Latin America, 
were relatively stagnant.

Is the advice to poor countries to look inward in the modern and increasingly 
globalizing world sincere, or is it designed to prevent competition in the 
U.S. market? Why advise developing countries to emulate the world's losers 
rather than the winners?

A dominant aspect of U.S. foreign policy today is to promote democracy 
wherever this seems feasible, such as in Latin America and the Caribbean, 
East Asia, Africa, and the transition nations of the former Soviet Union. 
This is a laudable effort. At the same time, however, the most severe U.S. 
trade restrictions are directed against imports from developing 
countries-such as sugar and textile products from just about everywhere, 
orange juice from Brazil, and steel from many developed and developing 
countries alike. U.S. foreign aid now represents 0.1 percent of our gross 
national product, placing it at the bottom of the list of donor countries. 
Our slogan used to be ""trade, not aid."" Now it is more like ""not too much 
trade and very little aid.""

It is extremely difficult for poor countries to establish stable democracies. 
Achieving this obective is made even more complex by the inherent 
contradiction in U.S. policy-preaching democracy even as we limit the ability 
of these countries to obtain the resources necessary to make democracy 
possible.

During the past year much invective has been hurled at key multilateral 
institutions established at the end of World War II. This was evident in 
Seattle late last year when protesters tried to disrupt the meetings of the 
World Trade Organization (the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade, which came into being in 1947), and again last month in Prague 
during the annual meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary 
Fund. It is not clear why the demonstrations were directed against these 
institutions rather than at the countries which determine the institutions' 
policies. They are not supranational bodies, but rather creatures of their 
masters, the world's most powerful national governments.

It is troubling when nongovernmental organizations exercise their right of 
free speech by preventing delegates to international meetings from exercising 
their right of free speech. We should not be troubled, however, when serious 
nongovernmental observers act constructively to change practices they find 
offensive. The IMF has long been ultrasecretive about its analyses and 
findings; this is inappropriate for an institution that obtains its funds 
from national governments (i.e., from taxpayers). The WTO's 
dispute-settlement procedures, which are an important part of that 
organization's work, have themselves been overly secretive. Many of these 
practices are changing, and the outside critics deserve much of the credit 
for this greater openness.

The president of the World Bank, James Wolfensohn, has exerted great effort 
to make the bank's work more transparent. At the same time, he exaggerates, 
incorrigibly so. He implies that the bank, under his leadership, has 
""discovered"" that economic growth, while necessary, is not sufficient to 
achieve widespread social development. There are many examples of this 
attitude. Only one will be cited: ""The old approach of an exclusive focus on 
growth as the elixir for all the world's problems is thus too circumscribed"" 
(op-ed by Wolfensohn and Joseph Stiglitz, Financial Times, September  22, 
1999). Wolfensohn's emphasis on alleviating poverty is praiseworthy, but the 
trashing of all the foreign aid practitioners who preceded him for not 
understanding the multiple aspects of development is egregiously inaccurate 
and ungracious.

The World Bank's World Development Report 2000/2001 is devoted exclusively to 
""attacking poverty."" It approaches this theme citing three areas for action: 
creating opportunities, empowering the poor, and providing greater security 
against the risks the poor face. The study contains a mountain of data and 
undoubtedly will be a valuable reference source for years to come. What it 
fails to do, however, is to explain how the World Bank can achieve these 
goals, particularly empowerment, which it admits depends on ""the interaction 
of political, social, and other institutional processes."" Is this the role of 
the World Bank?

Subject: Arena


I wanted to make sure you were aware of something that has come up since
the last breakfast meeting regarding our group financing the Arena parking
garage.  Baker & Botts put us in touch with the Rockets to discuss Hines
being the Development Manager on the Arena and garage.  Although not fully
agreed, there is strong interest on both sides.  Besides help on the
development front, we think there may be value in our acting as a bit of a
buffer between the Sports Authority and the Rockets and coordinating any
issues involving the new convention hotel(where we are also providing
development management).  The Rockets(Mike Goldberg-Baker & Botts) have
talked to Ric Campo and supposedly he is enthusiastic but thinks this
should ""be the Authority's idea."".  One issue is how much of our fee would
apply to the garage, which presumably the city would pick up, and how much
would apply to the Arena.  Since this is a fast moving issue, I wanted you
to know about this. Obviously the discussions are all very confidential.
If you have any thoughts in advance of the next breakfast meeting, please
give me a call at 713-966-2606.

Also, on another topic, we have been doing a tiny bit of pie in the sky
brainstorming on the concept of creating some kind of Futures/Options
market in the commercial space market.  I will approach Jeff Skilling
unless you would recommend elsewhere within Enron.

**********************************
New Jersey - Dick Zimmer

Former Congressman Dick Zimmer is a fiscally responsible,
socially moderate Republican who wants to reclaim the House seat
he held for three terms before his unsuccessful bid for U.S. Senate.
Most polls have him with a slight lead over his opponent.

To help Dick Zimmer, please visit

******************************************
Illinois - Mark Kirk

Mark Kirk is stressing fiscal conservatism and common-sense
improvements to schools and education. He has vowed to hold
the line on wasteful spending and insist on a balanced budget.
A recent A Chicago Tribune/WGN-TV poll has this race within the
margin of error.  To help Mark Kirk's campaign, visit

**************************************************
Indiana - John Hostettler

U.S. Representative John Hostettler faces a tough challenge from
Paul Perry, an orthopedic surgeon who has used his medical
connections to raise substantial amounts of money.  However,
Rep. Hostettler cannot be underestimated and has earned an 83%
rating with the U.S. Chamber in 1999.  Business should stand by
his side in this election that will likely be won by a narrow margin.

To help Rep. John Hostettler now, go to

Hostettler.htm.

**************************************************
Kentucky - Ernie Fletcher

Rep. Ernie Fletcher, who earned a 96% positive voting record
with the Chamber, is in a tough race and has come under heavy
criticism from anti-business forces for his votes supporting the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce's positions.   His loss would be a
symbolic victory for anti-business interests, which would like to
claim that his support of pro-business positions caused his
defeat.

Please help us help Rep. Fletcher by clicking here -

**************************************************
Michigan - Mike Rogers

Mr. Rogers is the cofounder of a family building business, an
ex-Army officer, and a former FBI special agent. He has a strong
understanding of the need to create and maintain a pro-business
environment.  Recent polls have him running slightly ahead of his
opponent, but the presidential campaigns make Michigan extremely
volatile.

**************************************************
Arkansas - Jay Dickey

U.S. Rep. Jay Dickey has earned an admirable 94% approval
rating from the U.S. Chamber. That's not surprising, since Dickey
is himself a small businessman, owning a number of food
franchises in Arkansas.  Rep. Dickey's opponent, State Senator
Michael Ross voted to raise the income tax rate on corporations.

**************************************************
California - Jim Rogan

Recent polling shows Rep. Jim Rogan with a slight lead over his
opponent.  However, this race is expected to be extremely close
come Election Day.  Rep. Rogan has consistently taken positions
supporting free enterprise, sponsoring legislation supporting
small businesses, voting for tax reforms and free trade and
advocating other key pro-business positions.  To help his
campaign, please visit

California - Steve Kuykendall

California's 36th District is a battleground this year with U.S.
Rep. Steve Kuykendall facing off against the previous
seatholder, Jane Harman. For business, the choice in this race
is clear: it's Kuykendall, who has voted with the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce 92% of the time. A true friend of free enterprise,
Rep. Kuykendell has earned the business community's support
or another term.

Rep. Brian Bilbray is in his toughest race since he ousted then-
Rep. Lynn Schenk in 1994.  As a business owner, Rep. Bilbray
understands the impact regulations and taxes can have on small
businesses. For his pro-business efforts, the U.S. Chamber

We are getting tremendous recruitment-advertising insertions into the 2001 IT 
Career Guide in the ""Employment Review"" banner feature within the ""USA Today"" 
Year in Review issue December 29, 30 & 31.

Many organizations are looking to get in front of the right candidates before 
the January 14 and 21 ""hiring rush"" that takes place in the Sunday 
newspapers' unemployment sections.

Consider this:

* Most candidates make the decision to seek new employment during the holiday 
season.

* Historically, ""Year In Review"" issues have broader readership and a longer 
shelf life.

* The December 29th weekend looks to be one of the heaviest travel periods of 
the year.

* The January 14 and 21 Sunday newspapers' unemployment sections will be the 
largest sections of the year - will your recruitment ad be seen?

* ""USA TODAY"" is the No. 1 read daily newspaper among IT professionals - 
reaching more than 4,600,000 active and passive IT candidates.

The ""2001 IT Career Guide"" will feature editorial on ""In-Demand Careers and 
Hot Industries"" for 2001 and a bannered recruitment-advertising section.

Reach candidates in your area with any one of the 25 advertising print

Subject: New Administration


Ken,

Sorry to miss you today when I called. Since I am leaving for India in a
few minutes, I thought I would sent you an E-mail, and then I can try to
call you from India. Because of the time difference, it will not be easy
for us to connect. Unfortunately I will not be back in the US until
December 7.

The reason for my call was to see if you would feel comfortable putting my
name forward to Dick Cheney for a position in the new administration. I am
not sure where the best fit would be, but it might be Chairman of the
National Economic Council. That job has a good combination of management
and economics. You know I have only been associated with Democratic
administrations in past, but Democratic administrations were a little
different in those days. You are somewhat familiar with my record on
economics and there is a lot on that in the public domain.

Just let me know what you think. Maybe a quick E-mail would suffice ( I am
carrying my computer).

Best regards,
Bill

Subject: Duchess of Northumbria's request

Ken

Thanks for sending me the request from the Duchess of Northumbria for help 
with her garden project.  I have discussed this with John Wakeham and our 
view is that unless you have any other reason for helping with this, we 
should say a polite ""no"".

The background is summarised on the attached briefing note from Mike O'Neill, 
Managing Director of Lurgi Invent.

Alnwick Castle is several hundred miles out of the Wessex region so it really 
is difficult to justify any Wessex help.  Lurgi Invent has done a little work 
for the Duchess in providing water features for the garden.  However, this 
business currently loses o1 million a year so we would be reluctant to see 
any sponsorship out of Lurgi Invent.

Given the nature of the project, the approach from the Duchess and the fact 
that she can clearly afford to pay for it herself, we really do believe no is 
the right answer.

Please let me know if you want any further information or if you want me to 
correspond direct with the Duchess.

Best wishes.

Colin

Subject:  Informal ISB Governing Board meeting in Davos, Switzerland during
      World Economic Forum


Dear Governing Board member,

On behalf of Rajat Gupta, Chairman of the Indian School of Business (ISB),
I am writing to invite you to an informal meeting of the ISB on Sunday
January 28, 2001 from 1000AM to 1200Noon at the Belvedere Hotel in Davos,
Switzerland. This date and location coincides with the World Economic Forum
meeting in Davos. We know that several of you will be at Davos, and we
would like to take this opportunity to have an informal meeting like we did
earlier this year. Based on feedback from the last meeting, we have limited
the meeting to two hours only. I do hope you will join us if you are going
to be in Davos. We will send out a detailed note on the agenda and
logistics once we hear back from you.

With thanks and best regards,

Pramath Sinha
CEO, ISB

Subject: New PUHCA Exemption Legislative Language

Yesterday, Ken Lay spoke with MidAmerican CEO David Sokol regarding the 
attached new legislative amendment to provide a limited PUHCA exemption for 
companies with a high level of financial stability as determined by 
independent market analysts (i.e. ""A"" rating for Holding Companies or 
investment grade rating for utility companies).  This is not a permanent 
exemption as PUHCA would again apply should the company loose its high rating.

MidAmerican's lobbyist reported this conversation to me along with Ken Lay's 
reported commitment that we would review it as soon as we could.  Reportedly, 
Ken Lay was non-committal but not negatively disposed.

The utility strategy is to have Senator Bob Kerrey (D-NE) offer this as an 
amendment to a ""must pass"" piece of legislation during the waning days of 
this Congressional session.  This will be separate from the utilities' 
strategy to enact Private Use legislation (H.R. 4971, S. 2967 which includes 
tax language to exclude water and sewage connection fees from gross income as 
contributions to capital and language to increase the amount permitted to 
paid into nuclear decommissioning reserve funds primarily  for Commonwealth 
Edison) and to enact stand-alone Reliability legislation (S. 2071 and H.R. 
2944).

Senator Kerrey has already spoken to Senator Gramm (R-TX) about this PUHCA 
amendment and Gramm was reportedly  non-committal but not negatively disposed 
to the idea.  I will follow-up with Gramm's staff next week after they've 
reviewed it and convey their views to you.  According to MidAmerican,  the 
concept to insure stockholder protection along with consumer protection was 
Senator Kerrey's idea.  

It is possible that Congressman Dingell (D-MI) and Congressman Markey (D-MA) 
would still actively oppose this limited exemption, especially given the fact 
that Congressman Dingell (who would Chair the Commerce Committee should the 
Democrats regain control of the House) has recently said that whether or not 
he is Commerce Committee Chairman next Congress, that comprehensive 
electricity restructuring legislation including PUHCA repeal is ""at least 
three years away from happening.""

Steve and Rick, can we get a temperature gauge next week as to our position 
on this amendment?  As a reminder, Enron's position here-to-date has been to 
oppose stand-alone PUHCA repeal as this is the one provision utilities like 
Southern Company really want.  To date, this strategy has worked with the 
MidAmerican Utility Group willing to support our transmission open access 
provisions in turn for our PUHCA exemption support.

 Dear Ken,

 As you know, our next meeting is on Wednesday, July 12 from
3:00-5:30 p.m.  In the next week or so, we'll be sending around a discussion
paper which we hope crystallizes the issues, and we will try to talk to as
many of you as possible before the meeting to go through it.

 Meanwhile, Arthur Levitt has agreed to meet with us in September to
brainstorm on the ideas we've generated and also to give us a sense of some
of the issues as he sees them.  There are three possible dates for the
meeting, which I suggest be in two parts -- first, a meeting among the panel
only from 5:00-6:30 p.m., and then a dinner with Chairman Levitt from
6:30-8:30 p.m.  Here are the dates:

 Could you please let us know which of these would be possible for
you:


  ___________ Thursday, September 14  5:00-8:30 pm

  ___________ Monday, September 25  5:00-8:30 pm

  ___________ Wednesday, September 27 5:00-8:30 pm



 Many thanks,

Dear Dr. Lay,
        In my last note, I believe I promised to check on the dates for the
Faculty-Alumni Awards ceremonies in the future.  The University and the MU
Alumni Association have them scheduled for:
        October 26, 2001,
        October 4, 2002, and
        October 10, 2003.
As I mentioned, the nominations are due February 1st of each year, and
attendance at the awards ceremony is necessary in order to receive it.  The
process is competitive, but I would like to proceed with your nomination
this coming winter if the 2001 date is available on your schedule.
        I visited with Mr. Purdy yesterday about a project at the Evans
Scholars House.  He and Mrs. Purdy seem to be doing fine - and enjoying the

Western State Power Forum: May 22 and May 23

Plans are proceeding nicely for the Western State Forum on May 22 and May
23.  We have an outstanding group of confirmed speakers and panelists
including many individuals that I assume you know as colleagues and friends.
I will be sending you more information on the Forum in the next few days. I
am going to send you the preliminary agenda  this morning.

You will be speaking at a critical time in the Forum; that is, just after
panels on power problems and polices and just before the final session
linking power and energy strategies to environmental objectives. It would be
great if your talk to the participants in the Forum could help them see the
relationship between power and energy related objectives and environmental
issues including GHG emissions. You should feel free however to focus your
talk in a manner of your choosing. Again, I will send you the prelim. agenda
soon.  Could you send me a title however for the final agenda's purposes?
We hope to print the final agenda later this week.    Thank you.

Gary, 
Least I forget!  On N5737 the other day (11/18) Mr. Lay reported to Bill 
Reddick that when his phone (#2 R/H seat) rings and he answers that it 
disconnects on him.  He told Bill that this is the third time he has reported 
this problem.  I spoke personally with Bill about this.  We checked and there 
is no record of this problem reported recently (we checked back to May 2000) 
on all three Falcon 900's.

Lyndel checked the system and there does seem to be a problem with it 
disconnecting if you pick it up before the third ring.  After the third ring 
it works fine.  That is all I know at this time.  Garrett Av is coming over 
today to check the system.

I know you don't like emails but I didn't want this it slip by.  I've 
discussed this with Ron and John as well.

Thanks for taking time out of  your schedule to spend some time with Alph
Bingham and me this week.  You and your team are breaking new ground in
your business with impressive speed.  We hope to match that type of
performance within e.Lilly.

I had several key takeaways that were notewothy:

1. Build your e.commerce strategy from the customer's perspective.  Louise,
you demonstrated this by the intense focus on the traders' requirements for
EnronOnline.
2. As Peter Drucker points out in his 1994 article on the ""Theory of
Business"", you must have clear assumptions about your environment, mission
and core competencies.  The establishment of Enron Networks seems to be
built upon your strong ability to assess a potential market for
commoditization and then leverage your strong trading capabilities and
control processes in order to create or redefine the market(eg. pulp/paper,
steel,bandwidth).
3. You provide people a chance to understand the business and be
accountable early in their career.  The example of one of your top traders
illustrated the performance-based culture that you are developing while
other examples showed the business breadth that is provided to key talent.
4. In the new economy (probably in the old one, too), there is no defense,
only offense.  Again, that mantra seems to grow out of a strong bias for
action within Enron Networks as you recognize that you must re-create
yourself (Online gas market) and move aggressively into new ones.
5. Louise, your EnronOnline initiative epitomized the phrase:  ""Ask for
forgiveness, not for permission.""  In other words, get it done; get it done
right, and the little things - like the budget - will take care of
themselves.

Let me know if we can ever return the favor.  Greg, we may want to discuss
a few risk management questions with you sometime in the future as we are
building some innovative discovery research ventures that would benefit
from your insight in this area.

Thanks again for your time.  Please thank Liz Taylor for us as well.  She
was very helpful.

                Lilly and Generex Sign Agreement To Develop

                          Buccal Form of Insulin



Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) and Generex Biotechnology Corporation

(NASDAQ: GNBT) today announced that they have signed an agreement to

develop a buccal formulation of insulin that is administered as a fine

spray into the oral cavity using Generex proprietary technology.



Under the terms of the agreement, Generex will receive certain initial fees

and milestone payments.  Generex will also receive royalty payments based

on product sales.  In exchange, Lilly will receive exclusive worldwide

rights to products resulting from the collaboration.  Lilly will be

responsible for conducting clinical trials, securing regulatory approvals

and marketing on a worldwide basis.  Clinical trials of the first product

candidate are under way in North America and Europe.  Lilly will also have

the option to develop a number of additional products depending on the

success of the initial product.



""We look forward to working with Generex, whose buccal spray delivery

technology potentially represents a novel approach to drug delivery,"" said

James A. Harper, president, diabetes and growth disorders products for

Lilly. ""A buccal spray formulation of insulin could provide an attractive

alternative for people with diabetes.""



""The opportunity to partner with Lilly, the global leader in insulins, to

develop the world's first marketed buccal insulin spray represents very

good news for millions of patients with diabetes throughout the world,""

said Anna Gluskin, chief executive officer of Generex. ""We are pleased that

Lilly has recognized the potential of buccal delivery of insulin and

Generex's RapidMist? technology for systemic delivery of proteins, peptides

and other large molecule drugs.""



Today, worldwide costs for treating diabetes and its complications are

estimated to exceed $200 billion annually.  It is also estimated that, over

the next decade, the number of people with this disease will more than

double.  Lilly has been a leader in diabetes care for more than 75 years.

The company continues to aggressively pursue the goal of being a complete

diabetes care company and intends to provide innovative products to treat

all types and stages of diabetes.



Generex is engaged in the research and development of drug delivery systems

and technologies. To date, it has focused on developing a platform

technology for the buccal delivery (absorption through the inner cheek

walls) of large molecule drugs which, historically, have been administered

only by injection. Additional information about Generex can be found at

www.generex.com.



Lilly, a leading innovation-driven corporation, is developing a growing

portfolio of best-in-class pharmaceutical products by applying the latest

research from its own worldwide laboratories and from collaborations with

eminent scientific organizations. Headquartered in Indianapolis, Ind.,

Lilly provides answers ? through medicines and information ? for some of

the world's most urgent medical needs.



Certain statements set forth above may constitute forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995. Although Generex and Lilly believe that such statements are
based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of their knowledge of
their business and operations, there can be no assurance that: (i) Lilly or
Generex will not terminate the collaboration, (ii) that any products will
be developed, manufactured or commercialized successfully, or (iii) that
significant funding will be received by Generex as a result of this
collaboration.

Each company's business is subject to significant risks and there can be no
assurance that actual results of the companies' development activities and
results of their operations will not differ materially from expectations.
For information with respect to other factors, which could cause actual
results to differ from expectations, reference is made to the 10-K and 10-Q
reports filed by Generex and Lilly, respectively, with the Securities and
Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Cougars@Enron is hosting our first annual golf tournament on March 26, 2001 
at Falcon Point Golf Club in Katy.  The purpose for the golf tournament is to 
provide scholarships for Enron dependants to attend the University of Houston 
and fund operating expenses.  Mr. Lay has graciously agreed to be our 
honorary chair for this event which will most certainly guarantee success.  I 
would like to ask that Enron participate in this event from a sponsorship 
capacity. Many Enron employees, University of Houston faculty, students and 
alumni will be participating and I believe that this will be a chance to 
promote the Enron name in all of those areas.  Considering that we are 
pushing the area of recruiting with this university, this will be an 
excellent way to enhance said efforts.  We will be marketing the sponsors 
through advertising, tournament recognition and special mention at the post 
tournament reception and dinner.  The levels are as follows:

Amount Level   What is received 
$5,000.00  Title sponsor  Advertising and recognition throughout the entire 
event.  2 teams of four to play the tournament.  Golf shirts, lunch and      
dinner  for sponsor participants.  Invitation to present scholarships at the 
scholarship dinner subsequent to the event.

$2,500.00 Gold sponsor  Advertising and recognition throughout the entire 
event.  1 team of four to play the tournament.  Golf shirts, lunch and 
dinner      for sponsor participants.  

$2,500.00 Silver sponsor  Advertising and recognition throughout the entire 
event.  2 people to play the tournament.  Golf shirts, lunch and dinner      
for sponsor participants.  

$100  Hole sponsor  Advertising at 1 hole of the tournament.

I believe that Enron would benefit from participating in this event.  The 
scholarships benefits Enron employees, there are 650 Enron employees that are 
graduates of the University of Houston who will take great pride in knowing 
that Enron supports their university, the recruiting program will benefit 
because deans, faculty, professional groups, students and alumni will be 
involved which should enhance relations that would beneficial to our efforts 
there.  

Please let me know what we can do.  I continue to believe that Cougars@Enron 
is a group that can benefit the company, the employees and the university and 
this tournament will be the key to its success.

Subject: Dinner with Tom DeLay and others on April 6th -- additional infor 
mation


To: Bruce LaBoon, Steve Miller, Charles Duncan, Ken Lay, Steve
Letbetter, Dan Smith, Kelly Frels, Ed Galante, Jim Edmonds, Jim Kollaer

The purpose of this email is to provide additional detail to follow up on
the phone call each of you received on Friday, checking availability for
dinner with Congressman DeLay and others on Friday, April 6th.

BACKGROUND  During the last week of February, BCCA and Partnership leaders
met separately with Congressman DeLay, Congressman Joe Barton and with two
top staff members of Mr. DeLay, in order to update them on our extensive
activities aimed at federal Clean Air Act compliance.  Pursuant to those
meetings, Mr. DeLay's office has asked for some follow-up meetings to be
held in Houston on Friday, April 6th.   He intends to travel to this area on
that day along with, and as host to, Congressman Barton (R-Texas, Chairman
of the Energy and Power Subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and
Commerce) and with Congressman Billy Tauzin (R-Louisiana, Chairman, House
Committee on Energy and Commerce).    The Energy and Commerce Committee has
oversight over Clean Air Act matters.  DeLay has requested support from and
interaction with the BCCA and the Partnership on that day.

APRIL 6TH ACTIVITY  After time spent early in the day in Mr. DeLay's
congressional district to meet with Brazoria and Fort Bend County local
officials, Mr. DeLay has asked us to then pick up the itinerary with a ship
channel tour and presentations on SIP status, science and modeling issues.
We are working closely with Mr. DeLay's staff on all these matters.

He has asked to end the day with a ""small dinner with CEOs"" to have a frank
discussion about our clean air issues.  This is the dinner my staff called
your office about on Friday.  Clearly, Mr. DeLay is interested in what he
and the other congressmen may be able to due legislatively to assist in
addressing some of the issues we have with the SIP.   He has asked that we
also invite Governor Perry to attend the dinner, which we are doing.  Mr.
DeLay will call the Governor to encourage his attendance.  This will
obviously be a critical opportunity to relay targeted information and advise
on strategy with key members of Congress and the Governor.  Everyone in
attendance at the dinner will be provided coordinated talking points in
advance.  There may also be a formal briefing arranged immediately before or
after the April 3 Partnership Board meeting so we can prep in advance.

RSVPs TO DATE  Responses so far indicate that Steve Miller, Ed Galante, Jim
Edmonds and Jim Kollaer are confirmed to attend the dinner.  Charles Duncan
and Kelly Frels are checking calendars.  Ken Lay, Steve Letbetter and Dan
Smith are unavailable.  We do not have a commitment yet from the Governor.
We will likely recruit two or three other CEOs from BCCA member companies to
attend the dinner.

My current thought is to house the members of Congress at the St. Regis and
to arrange the dinner either at the River Oaks Country Club or possibly at a
board member's home nearby.

I trust this additional information is useful to you.  I will be the
Partnership point person on this -- please do not hesitate to call me with
any questions you may have.  Thank you.

Thanks for sending me the request from the Duchess of Northumbria for help 
with her garden project.  I have discussed this with John Wakeham and our 
view is that unless you have any other reason for helping with this, we 
should say a polite ""no"".

The background is summarised on the attached briefing note from Mike O'Neill, 
Managing Director of Lurgi Invent.

Alnwick Castle is several hundred miles out of the Wessex region so it really 
is difficult to justify any Wessex help.  Lurgi Invent has done a little work 
for the Duchess in providing water features for the garden.  However, this 
business currently loses o1 million a year so we would be reluctant to see 
any sponsorship out of Lurgi Invent.

Given the nature of the project, the approach from the Duchess and the fact 
that she can clearly afford to pay for it herself, we really do believe no is 
the right answer.

Please let me know if you want any further information or if you want me to 
correspond direct with the Duchess.

Best wishes.

talking points for your use.

Overall message:  the market is working, regulation is not.

In California, peak demand rose by 10% over the last 4 years while new 
capacity grew by only 2%.  But, as you would expect, the market responded by 
proposing 8,000MW of new generation - - more than enough to offset the peak 
demand growth.  The regulatory process, at both the state and local level, 
has failed to site this new generation.  The problem is regulation, not 
deregulation.

When San Diego customers began experiencing the effects of higher prices, 
Enron responded with a fixed price which would have shielded San Diego 
customers from price volatility and provided prices below their current 
summer levels (Enron's price was about $55/MWH).  After publication of 
Enron's offer, nine other companies made offers.  Again, the market responded 
where regulation failed.  San Diego has not accepted any of these offers 
because of regulatory/legislative restrictions on its ability to buy outside 
of the PX (i.e. the spot market).

In markets where siting is easier, suppliers have moved to build additional 
generation.  Enron built 3 plants in response to the 1998 price spikes.  
Those plants were planned, sited and built in less that 12 months - - in time 
for the summer of 1999.  Where regulatory hurdles are lower, the market 
responds.

The solution to current pricing and reliability issues is more competition 
not reregulation.  Policy makers should:

Open the transmission grid so that power can get from where it is to where it 
is needed.

Expedite interconnection of new generation.

Expedite siting of new facilities.

Give customers a choice, so that they have better access to demand side 
solutions.


Also attached is a more detailed discussion of California, prepared by Jeff 
Dasovich of our San Francisco office.

Subject: EGEP Sale Announcement

Ken, Jeff , Joe & Cliff,

This is a copy a note I sent to PR(Steve Kean & John Ambler), IR(Mark Koenig) 
and Enron India(Sanjay Bhatnagar & Jimmy Mogal) regarding our internal 
announcement to  EGEP/EOGIL employees in Houston and India on October 13, 
2000.


On Friday (last night Houston time) we announced to employees Enron's 
decision to sell Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd. (EOGIL), our subsidiary that owns 
a 30% interest in the Panna, Mukta and Tapti concession areas.    We now have 
bankers involved and a data room is being prepared in Houston which  made it 
extremely difficult to keep the deal quiet any longer.  There were numerous 
rumors circulating through the office, but the reality of the announcement 
was still a shock to most of the employees in India and Houston. Basically we 
said the following:
 1) Selling assets or companies is a routine part of Enron's strategy to 
redeploy capital in the higher return opportunities.  The company has 
exposure to a number of tremendous opportunities today that were not 
envisioned even twelve months ago.  In line with this strategy, we are 
placing EOGIL in the market.
 2) Depending on the success of finding an acceptable buyer for EOGIL,  we 
will be reviewing the balance of our portfolio for transfer to other Enron 
entities or for sale as separate packages.  We anticipate closing the EOGIL 
transaction and rationalizing the remaining portfolio by March 31, 2001.  
 3) Pending the success outlined in item #2, we will eliminate Enron Global 
E&P as an Enron business unit on March 31, 2001.
 4) We announced some interim staff changes to facilitate the process. 
  a) Jeff Sherrick would re-focus his time largely on the sale process
  b) Mike Stewart will be responsible for all India activity except the sale 
process
  c) Steve Harper will be responsible for EGEP's sale activity and 
coordination with our bankers and Corporate Development
 5) Commented on the potential impact to employees in general terms.  We told 
them it was pre-mature to outline all of the possibilities until we signed a 
PSA with a buyer.  However, in general, there is a good likelihood that many 
people will either have opportunities for future employment with the buyers 
or through redeployment within Enron.  Those people that do not remain with 
the assets or are not redeployed in Enron will be involuntarily terminated 
March 31, 2001 unless they are needed to close a transaction or to provide

I would like to keep this as low-keyed as possible.  Last year when we were 
for sale there were not a lot of comments, but you never know.  If anyone in 
the media picks up on this I would expect it to happen early next week.  Mike 
Stewart is currently in India in the Mumbai office (01191228395841) and can 
be reached at the Mariott after-hours(01191228577878).  He is fully briefed 
on our position regarding the activities within EGEP and EOGIL.  Mike will be 
traveling offshore and to Baroda over the weekend and on Monday.  I will be 
available all weekend and next week at the following numbers; (work) 
713-853-5934, (home) 281-320-2198, (cell) 713-569-4713.  I would suggest 
talking with Mike or I before making any comments to the media if possible.

This afternoon I notified our partners and the Gov't of India of our 
intention to market our assets.  I will be making a trip to India soon to 
visit with the appropriate people in these organizations within the next two 
weeks.  While I wouldn't expect this to happen, please refer any inquiries 
from our partners (ONGC and Reliance) or the GOI to Mike or me.  As you might 
expect, we want to be careful and consistent in our message to these 
groups.   

I will keep you informed regarding any changes to the above.  If you have any 
questions, contact me at the above numbers.

Ken.

I wanted to get back with regarding your question of Ghana.  You might 
remember that Ralph Hodge had indicated to you that you may well be hearing 
from the Ghanaian Ambassador.  Ralph believes that he will try to facilitate 
a meeting between you and Chevron.

We have been working Ghana pretty hard, including the West African Gas 
Pipeline, the Effasu Power Project, a marketing company and a host of other 
possibilities.  We have told the Ghanaians that with what is going on right 
now in Nigeria, the loss of projects in Cote d'Ivoire due to the coup d'etat, 
and the lack of speed in moving forward in Ghana , that we are slowing down a 
bit to determine if we can resolve current projects before taking on 
additional ones.  

Clearly this is a bit of a ""cop out"".  I am reluctant to tell Ghana that we 
are slowing down generally in Africa because I don't want to hurt the barge 
deal or jepordize the possible resolution of the large snowball in Mozambique 
and there is truth to the Cote d'Ivoire and Nigeria issues.  And, of course, 
I don't want to alienate Ghana generally.  I have a good relationship with 
the Ambassador from Ghana, in fact, I just got a postcard from him two days 
ago, and when he returns to the US he has indicated that he will call me.  I 
will deliver this message, hopefully diverting the call to you.  If he does 
get to you first, he won't be upset for you to send him on to me, I don't 
believe.

If there is any clarification, please give me a holler.  I hope the office 
opening has gone well.  I've extracted many a promise from participants to 
drink a pint for me.

Rebecca

*********************************************

Energy Trends and Geopolitics.

The OPEC heads-of-state summit should be appraised on three different levels, 
according to Luis Giusti, CSIS senior adviser. Despite speculation that 
decisions about the market would be forthcoming, nothing was bound to happen 
because the operational agenda will be dealt with in the organization's 
meeting in November. At the institutional level, the summit was undoubtedly a 
success for OPEC, as it clearly reinforced the spirit of the organization by 
strengthening the union among member countries. Additionally, at the 
political level the meeting provided a platform for Venezuelan president Hugo 
Chavez to deliver what has become his ""north-south"" position and message. It 
is important to keep in mind, though, that Saudi Arabia's dominance and 
leadership will continue, by virtue of its high production capacity, and we 
can expect continuity in its pragmatic approach toward the market and the 
price of oil. As a result, Chavez's speeches should be viewed in perspective 
and not overplayed.

As for the United States' release of 30 million barrels of oil from the 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), Giusti says that the move has clearly 
provoked an immediate reaction in the desired direction, with oil prices 
falling some $5 per barrel. In tapping the SPR at this moment, the U.S. 
action denotes a mode of cooperation and not confrontation. OPEC countries 
have already increased production significantly, and they have repeatedly 
sent the message that they have done their part and somebody else has to do 
something to bring down prices. The move comes too late, however, to bring 
any relief to the winter's tight oil heating situation: aside from the fact 
that the U.S. refining network is operating at practically full capacity, the 
oil released will not be refined before December, and, as a result, the 
refined products will not start reaching the market before January. But the 
move does have an effect on the price of oil, which is the root of the 
problem. As for the Heating Oil Strategic Reserve currently being accrued, 
its small size (2 million barrels) can have only a modest impact on prices. 
Moreover, its triggering mechanism is not yet clear.

Robert Ebel, director of the CSIS Energy Program, thinks the United States 
should not touch the reserve. Domestic oil producers are finally turning a 
profit and will be unhappy as crude oil prices fall. Moreover, just-in-time 
philosophies of operation keep stocks low, meaning the inventories simply 
will not be there if demand rises sharply this winter despite the release of 
reserves. Ebel suggests that New England take steps to diversify the kinds of 
fuel consumed during the winter.

According to Ebel, the reserve withdraw is playing to the psychological part 
of the market more than anything else. After the announcement of the reserve 
withdraw, prices began to drop without a single new drop of oil entering the 
marketplace. What will happen next August when it is time to replenish the 
reserve, wonders Ebel.

Moreover, U.S. refineries are already operating at 95%-96% capacity daily. To 
make room in the refineries for the reserve oil, the United States will have 
to give up some of the oil it imports. This crowding out of imports will 
bring down prices elsewhere, notes Ebel. The United States is therefore 
subsidizing foreign consumers. Ebel says the United States should have 
coordinated the reserve withdraw with other countries if it truly wanted to 
have a global impact on prices.

Turning to Iraq, the high price of oil contributes to the erosion of the 
sanctions in place. Iraqi oil now plays a key role in global supplies and 
prices. This gives the Iraqi regime increased leverage, says Charles Duelfer, 
a visiting fellow in the CSIS Middle East Program.

While Iraq is unlikely to actually halt its oil exports, the potential to do 
so provides Iraq with a ""deterrent force"" of some significance. Iraq made 
modest reductions in output earlier this year when the UN sanctions committee 
delayed approval of funding for oil infrastructure repairs. The Iraqi regime 
has a great appreciation of power-whether through weapons of mass destruction 
or through oil. Iraq can be expected to take every opportunity to increase 
its production capacity as circumstances permit, perhaps with an ultimate 
goal of displacing Saudi Arabia as OPEC's dominant player.

improper bidding and award of the Panna/Mukta block concluded today.  Our 
legal team's opinion is very optimistic based on the way the proceeding 
progressed and also on the actions of the chief judge during the concluding 
arguments of the case today in India. 

The panel of three judges will now take approximately 2 months to write their 
opinion and that should complete this case.  While I probably shouldn't  
speculate on the outcome, I will summarize my opinion of the important 
points:  1) there is little doubt that the Panna/Mukta award to 
Enron/Reliance/ONGC will stand, and  2) it is highly unlikely that the judges 
will request the PSC to be renegotiated, the contract was portrayed and 
generally accepted by the panel as a very fair deal for the GOI.  According 
to my general counsel, Stephen Wallace, the only concern our team has is that 
the judges were quite critical of the CBI (the government group that 
investigated Reliance for wrong doing in the bid process) during that portion 
of the testimony and there is a possibility that they could request an 
additional investigation.  Our team puts the likelihood of the judges 
ordering a new investigation at less than 50%.  There is downside to such a 
decision in that it creates uncertainty, but the focus would be on Reliance, 
not Enron. 

Enron was very prepared on the commercial and the legal front and our team, 
as expected, carried the load for this case even though we were not the 
primary defendants.  Enron presented the major rebuttal to the CPIL 
assertions because the others were not prepared and then later ""coached"" the 
others to help them prepare appropriately.   This was a much more intensive 
case than people were assuming it would be last year and we were very 
fortunate to be extremely well prepared and well represented.   

Based on the above information,  I do not think this issue ""CPIL lawsuit""  
should  impact any future decisions we make regarding the Panna/ Mukta/Tapti 
assets.  This outcome basically eliminates one of the two issues impeding the 
progress of  the  project I showed Joe, our proposal to sell 
Panna/Mukta/Tapti, that we call Project Janus.  We believe we have a unique 
opportunity to realize exceptional value for these assets through an 
arrangement with our partner.  The strategy we have mapped out should  allow 
us to close the transaction prior to year-end and it has very positive cash 
flow and neutral financial implications (minimal if any gain due to the 
step-up last year) for the company.   The only remaining hurdle is a tax 
issue that we are currently working.

    We routinely work with applications that have been ""sent to the national
office.""  If an application is ""sent to the national office,"" it means that
an issue or issues have been identified in the application by the original
reviewing agent that give the agent pause, and which the agent feels a more
technical review by a more skilled agent is required.  It always means that
there is some problem with the application that could result in denial of the
application.

    I suspect that what the IRS would really like your client to do is
establish objective standards in your organization's fundamental documents
for determining who is to receive the assistance of the charity.   Such
standards would give the IRS assurance that only poor people would receive
the benefits, and make it easier to determine if the mission was being
adhered to in an audit of activities.  Addressing this concern could be as
simple as enacting a Bylaw amendment or more likely an amendment to the
Articles of Incorporation.

    Last year, our office was brought in at the ""national office"" stage, well
after the Form 1024 was filed, to help a group of ranchers and cattlemen in
Wyoming/Montana opposed to illegal imports of below cost beef, to obtain
trade association status, (501(c)(6)), that the national office kept trying
to deny by saying they were an agriculture organization (which meant
potentially less availability of tax deductible contributions under o162).
What we did in that case was setup a conference call with the client's
lawyers and the IRS national office team assigned to the file.  We talked
through the application, identified each and every problem the IRS had
identified, and then our firm prepared, in essence, a supplemental brief
addressing each issue.  In the process, we learned that a few minor changes
to the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, plus the supplemental
application information, were enough to address the IRS's agents concerns,
and they issued the tax determination letter.

    Thus, I would suggest that you request a conference call with the
national office agent or ""team"" reviewing the application, and get them to
identify each and every concern with the application.   Then, ask them for a
period of time to respond.  Ask them if changes in the fundamental corporate
documents would help address their concerns.  And of course, be mindful that
if you have had ongoing activities, you will want to be sure that anything
you do will result in retroactive deductibility for what contributions you
have already received.

    During late 1999, the IRS was accused of responding to political pressure
in triggering audits of exempt organizations by the Landmark Legal
Foundation, a conservative, Washington, D.C. legal foundation.  Landmark did
a Freedom of Information Act request and released documents which tended to
indicate that the IRS was auditing groups in response to complaints from
Congressmen.  The IRS denied that political influence plays a role in its
decisions, and, since then, the IRS exempt organizations unit has been very
careful about not creating an impression that they respond to political
pressure.

    If your client would like our firm to help as a consultant to work with
the national office, we'd be pleased to be of assistance.  We would need to
review the file and have your client execute a Form 2848 Power of Attorney
for us to join the team.

    Hope this is helpful.

We have finally been able to track down a resume for Nelson Steele.  Based 
upon his resume he is not someone we would have invited to interview for the 
Analyst Program.  We have also spoken to the Portland Office regarding the 
interview that Nelson had with them.  According to Amy Fitzpatrick, the HR 
Rep in Portland, when he interviewed he was extremely unimpressive.  
Consequently, he was not extended an offer by the Portland Office.  When they 
called to tell him such, his response was, ""that's OK because I did not want 
to work there anyway.""

I am doubtful that he will fare well in the interview process but will bring 
him in if that is what is desired.  Please let me know how you wish for us to 
proceed.  Thanks.

Mayor Brown, HISD Superintendent Rod Paige and Ed Allday, event chair for the

speaker to spend approximately five minutes talking about the importance of 
diversity in their respective environments. For example, the mayor will talk 
about diversity in the city of Houston, Rod Paige will speak to diversity in 
schools, Ed will talk about how the event highlights diversity, and you would 
be asked to talk about how Enron approaches diversity in the work-place.

If you are able to do this, Community Relations will draft your speaking

and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") transactions in Lilly stock.  In light of
the complexity of the reporting rules and the potential for severe
penalties for noncompliance, please contact me in advance of any
transaction.  As a reminder, the SEC rules cover all transactions,
including:

-   purchases
-   sales
-   gifts
-   trust or partnership transactions
-   transactions in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan
-   exchange fund transactions

We request advance notification of Lilly stock transactions for two
reasons:

   There are certain times when you should not engage in market
   transactions in Lilly stock.  Routinely, these ""black-outs"" occur around
   the end of each quarter through the time quarterly/annual earnings are
   announced.  In addition, occasionally, we are aware of ""inside
   information"" that may be considered material and we therefore advise our
   reporting persons to avoid open market transactions in Lilly stock.
   While you may not know of the event, the knowledge may be imputed to
   you.  Advance communication allows you to avoid situations that may have
   legal consequences, or if not, at least may cause embarassment.

2.   We prepare for you the required reports of the transaction to the SEC.

If you had any Lilly stock transactions in September, please advise me as
soon as possible.  We will prepare the required reports for your signature
and file them with the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange (""NYSE"").  The
reports must be received by the SEC and the NYSE no later than the 10th day
of the month following the month in which the transaction occurs.  If I am
not available, please contact Jim Lootens (317-276-5835) regarding any
proposed transaction.

If you have any questions regarding these matters, please do not hesitate
to call me.  Thank you for your cooperation.

I hope things are well with you.

I've taken on in the last year of my 6 year term the regents' chairmanship
and so I am busy working on how to help further accelerate the good things
that have occurred since we brought Art and his team to Houston.  In this
light, I read the recent article in the Wall Street Journal suggesting that
the Kuht-TV spectrum allotment includes substantial unused bandwidth which
we are legally permitted to lease to the private sector.  The Journal, based
on the recent UK auction, extrapolated the overall worth of the bandwidth at
$160 billion.  Needless to say, if we could realize a small fraction of
that, for something from which we currently derive nothing, it could be a
huge boost to our efforts to obtain the additional funding we need as we
move to Tier One status.

Since Enron is the leader in the market for bandwidth, I was hoping you or
someone at Enron could give us some advice on what we own, its value, if
any, and how we might think about realizing on any such value.  From Enron's
perspective, perhaps there is a niche market for Enron to make by helping
organize educational institutions that own such bandwidth to exploit the
value of that asset.

Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards.

Gary

	tee 7.16-19.01","Ken,

Houston's bid for the 2012 Olympic Games is entering the final phase of the
domestic bid process.  This summer, the United States Olympic Committee
(USOC) will conduct initial site visits and evaluations of the eight U.S.
bid cities with the goal being to cut the number of cities to three or four.
This cut will occur in December of this year.  The USOC will be conducting
Houston's site visit July 16-19, 2001.

This site visit is critical to our ultimate success in bringing the Olympic
Games to Houston.  Over the four-day period in which the USOC site
evaluation team is in Houston, two days will be devoted to venue tours and
presentations.  There are eight presentation topics predetermined by the
USOC, one of which is International Strategy. Simply stated, this is where
we show why we think Houston can win on the international level.

As a Port Commissioner and a board member of Houston 2012, I will be part of
the team that presents this section to the USOC site evaluation team.  As
arguably the most identifiable international corporate leader in Houston and
as the Chairman of the 1990 Economic Summit and the 1992 Republican National
Convention, both of which you left with a positive surplus (very important
to the Olympics), you are in an excellent position to discuss Houston's
international status.

George DeMontrond, Susan Bandy (the Houston 2012 Exec Director) and I would
very much appreciate 15 minutes or so of your time to update you on
Houston's bid efforts and discuss your potential participation in the
upcoming site visit. You are our first and only choice, and I'd like the
opportunity to show you how important this is for Houston. We expect the
number of U.S. bid cities to be reduced to four finalists by this December
as a result of these meetings.  I will call Rosalee to schedule a time for a
visit at your offices. All the best and I look forward to catching up with
you soon. I'm attaching my bio, which details the last few years of activity
I've been involved with, most of which emanated from your support for me on
the UH Board of Regents, the 1990 Economic Summit Host Committee, the 1992
RNC Convention and later the GHP. Thank you for everything you've done for
Sarah and me -- hopefully I've reciprocated by doing a good job for you each
time.

My name is Cole Albon.  I work for Sigaba, a secure internet communications
company and I'd like to get you started using our technology.   We enable a
""send secure"" button in an existing email client so that your sensitive
emails can be sent across the internet in privacy.  Sigaba is extremely easy
to use and works on both internal and external company email.  I'd like you
and your executive team to start using our software.  Then, if it makes
sense for you to use our encryption solution on a company wide basis, I'd
like to present you with an enterprise solution.

Why?
- When you send an email, it is sent through several servers on the way to
its recipient.
- These servers are not owned by you or the recipient, so many people can
read the contents.
- Given your position, you probably send information that you don't want
others to read.
- Sigaba can give you the technology to protect your emails without you
changing your software or email habits.

My contact information is below and you can download our software at

to contact me directly or forward my contact information to your Manager of

award celebration in Houston in 1993.  Since that time, I have had some 
health problems that are leading me to retire a little early from Enron, on 
August 31, 2000. 

 I did not want to leave Enron's active employment until I had the 
opportunity to express to you my gratitude.  I have been with Northern 
Natural Gas, InterNorth, HNG-InterNorth and Enron for thirty two years and 1 
month.  I can tell you without hesitation, that since you took over our 
company in the late 80's, it has been the most challenging and exciting time 
that I have spent in my work life.  I had opportunities that I never dreamt 
of and I am grateful for the opportunities that I have had.   I started on 
August 1, 1968 as a maintenance helper at the South Omaha location of 
Northern Natural Gas.  I was a field technician, an O&M Supervisor, a 
District Manager, and presently the Manager of the Operations Communications 
Center in Omaha.

I have admired and respected you since the first time we met in Des Moines, 
Iowa, shortly after the merger.  Without your guidance and direction and the 
many employee based programs you have initiated, I would not be where I am 
financially today.  I am looking forward to retirement without concern for me 
or my family's future.  The ESOP program was so very important to all of the 
employees, and the many other programs like our ""options"", variable pay 
(bonus) and others make Enron a leader throughout the world in employee 
satisfaction, and we have the awards to prove it.

The employees that I have worked with in these 32 years are the bright spots 
for Enron, not only in the past but also into the future.  We have done a 
wonderful job of getting the best of the best.

I hope that I will be able to thank you in person and shake your hand once 
more, perhaps at a future shareholders meeting.

Sincerely,

Rod Williams

If you are inclined to accept this invitation, we could put together an 
interesting talk on the importance of good mental health to business with 
some national statistics and then segue into Enron's emphasis on wellness and 
having fun in the workplace.  Our strategy and experience will be very 
interesting to the group since it shows what a corporate leader is doing to 
become the employer of choice in the marketplace.

You could expect a full house (around 400) for the talk.  If it fits into 
your schedule, Jack Bowen said he would be delighted to be honorary chairman 
of the event.

Mr. Lay,
?
Your assistant contacted me a couple weeks back with the message that the  
attached was not an opportunity you could consider at this time.? Thanks  
very much, though, for taking a look at it.
?
I have one follow-up question for you -- could you recommend another Enron  
executive that might be a candidate for such an opportunity?? 
?
To help you answer the question, the company is Juno Online?Services,  
Inc.?(NASDAQ: JWEB), a leading US ISP.? Juno is very interested in  working 
with (and in advanced-stage discussions with) companies in the energy  
industry and working with them on strategic telecommunications and marketing  
partnerships.
?
Information about Juno is available at ""About Juno"" on Juno's Web site 
http://www.juno.com.? I've also attached an  executive summary to update you 
(or the relevant person at Enron) as to the  current status of Juno's 
business.
?
Thanks very much for your assistance, and I hope that this message finds  you 
well.
?
Best,
?
Toby

Executive Overview of?Juno --

The company finished 4Q00 w/ $56MM in cash.? Total net loss for 2001  was 
projected to be $10-$25MM, as the company focuses on billable services,  
continues to reduce expenses, and looks to develop advertising and other  
ancillary revenue streams.? The company is confident that it can meet  
or?beat the loss target and made explicit statements that on-hand cash  
resources are ""more than adequate"" to get the business profitable.? The  
company has not publicly given a time-line for profitability to maintain  
flexibility.  
The company controls one of the largest dialup subscriber audiences (4MM  
active subscribers as of 4Q00, 850K of whom are billable) on the Internet  
today and is the 4th largest US ISP (after AOL, ELNK, and MSN).  
2000 revenue came in at $114MM, 65% of which was derived from subscription  
fees and 35% from advertising.? 2001 revenues are expected to come in  
between $100MM-$120MM, with the revenue mix moving toward 80% subscription 
and  20% advertising due to increased focus on billable services and the 
soft  Internet advertising markets.  
Juno has announced broadband agreements for its Juno Express product  
covering all mainstream broadband transport platforms -- AT&T Broadband,  
Time Warner Cable, and Comcast (cable); Covad (DSL); Hughes (satellite); and  
Metricom (wireless).  
The company has announced wireless distribution agreements for it's Juno  
Mobile product with Palm and Sprint PCS.? Other agreements are likely to  be 
forthcoming.  
The company has powerful propietary technology assets that give it a  
competitive advantage.? The company has launched (internally but not  
publicly) a new business unit -- Juno Solutions -- to investigate the  
opportunity to license these technology assets to third parties both  
domestically and internationally.?  
The Juno Virtual Supercomputer Project represents another example of  Juno's 
efforts to develop ancillary revenue streams.? This distributed  computing 
initiative aims to leverage unused computer processing power from  Juno's MMs 
of subscribers, aggregating it for sale to biotech, pharmaceutical,  and 
computational chemistry firms.?

It was good to talk with you last week, and I hope you got some vacation in 
Aspen.? I'm working at it! 

Rosalie said you'd be getting in this afternoon, and I? wanted to reach you 
by phone or e-mail before Governor Tony Knowles from Alaska calls you.? 
Governor Knowles (classmate of George W.), along with Governor Taft of Ohio, 
has enlisted us in a conference that seven governors are sponsoring on 
natural gas in order to elucidate the market and issues -- and needs -- 
before it explodes as a political issue -- and perhaps helps head it off (in 
contrast to what happened with gasoline).? Governor Knowles is the current 
chairman of the Interstate Oil Compact Commission, and it will be under the 
auspices of the IOCC.? They promise at least seven governors and a lot of 
other distinguished people.? It seems to us that this is a very timely event.

They would like to invite you to be the luncheon speaker.? (I will be kicking 
off the conference).?? It looks to be a very good and high visibility 
platform.? And they would be very keen and excited -- and honored -- to have 
you in that featured role in it works for your schedule.

It takes place in Columbus, Ohio, on September 20. 

Tony is a very good guy, and of course natural gas as well as oil looms very 
large for him.? You'll enjoy talking with him.? He can certainly fill you in 
further on what they would like to accomplish.

If it works out for you to do this in terms of your schedule and interest, 
that would be great. 

On behalf of the governors, thank you for the consideration. 

Best,

This is a copy a note I sent to PR(Steve Kean & John Ambler), IR(Mark Koenig) 
and Enron India(Sanjay Bhatnagar & Jimmy Mogal) regarding our internal 
announcement to  EGEP/EOGIL employees in Houston and India on October 13, 
2000.


On Friday (last night Houston time) we announced to employees Enron's 
decision to sell Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd. (EOGIL), our subsidiary that owns 
a 30% interest in the Panna, Mukta and Tapti concession areas.    We now have 
bankers involved and a data room is being prepared in Houston which  made it 
extremely difficult to keep the deal quiet any longer.  There were numerous 
rumors circulating through the office, but the reality of the announcement 
was still a shock to most of the employees in India and Houston. Basically we 
said the following:
 1) Selling assets or companies is a routine part of Enron's strategy to 
redeploy capital in the higher return opportunities.  The company has 
exposure to a number of tremendous opportunities today that were not 
envisioned even twelve months ago.  In line with this strategy, we are 
placing EOGIL in the market.
 2) Depending on the success of finding an acceptable buyer for EOGIL,  we 
will be reviewing the balance of our portfolio for transfer to other Enron 
entities or for sale as separate packages.  We anticipate closing the EOGIL 
transaction and rationalizing the remaining portfolio by March 31, 2001.  
 3) Pending the success outlined in item #2, we will eliminate Enron Global 
E&P as an Enron business unit on March 31, 2001.
 4) We announced some interim staff changes to facilitate the process. 
  a) Jeff Sherrick would re-focus his time largely on the sale process
  b) Mike Stewart will be responsible for all India activity except the sale 
process
  c) Steve Harper will be responsible for EGEP's sale activity and 
coordination with our bankers and Corporate Development
 5) Commented on the potential impact to employees in general terms.  We told 
them it was pre-mature to outline all of the possibilities until we signed a 
PSA with a buyer.  However, in general, there is a good likelihood that many 
people will either have opportunities for future employment with the buyers 
or through redeployment within Enron.  Those people that do not remain with 
the assets or are not redeployed in Enron will be involuntarily terminated 
March 31, 2001 unless they are needed to close a transaction or to provide 
transition services to a buyer.
 
I would like to keep this as low-keyed as possible.  Last year when we were 
for sale there were not a lot of comments, but you never know.  If anyone in 
the media picks up on this I would expect it to happen early next week.  Mike 
Stewart is currently in India in the Mumbai office (01191228395841) and can 
be reached at the Mariott after-hours(01191228577878).  He is fully briefed 
on our position regarding the activities within EGEP and EOGIL.  Mike will be 
traveling offshore and to Baroda over the weekend and on Monday.  I will be 
available all weekend and next week at the following numbers; (work) 
713-853-5934, (home) 281-320-2198, (cell) 713-569-4713.  I would suggest 
talking with Mike or I before making any comments to the media if possible.

This afternoon I notified our partners and the Gov't of India of our 
intention to market our assets.  I will be making a trip to India soon to 
visit with the appropriate people in these organizations within the next two 
weeks.  While I wouldn't expect this to happen, please refer any inquiries 
from our partners (ONGC and Reliance) or the GOI to Mike or me.  As you might 
expect, we want to be careful and consistent in our message to these 
groups.   

I will keep you informed regarding any changes to the above.  If you have any 
questions, contact me at the above numbers.

there are three points that I mentioned but I think got lost in the 
discussion.

1)  This needs to be a stock deal to avoid Indian tax (48%), poorly written 
preferential purchase language and gov't approval.  (Still requires RBI 
approval)  All of the numbers I have in the document assume a stock 
transaction. 

2) RIL is very tax advantaged, currently and for the foreseeable future they 
will be in an NOL position;  therefore, at the numbers we are discussing they 
should see this as an unleveraged return opportunity of 16% (stock purchase 
fully taxed with no basis) to 27% (stock purchase shielded from taxes-- Btax 
scenario).   Again, the tax position makes RIL unique for this transaction 
and a very likely buyer at these numbers.  Few other parties will be as 
positioned to consider a stock transaction of a company with minimal Indian 
basis, accept the operational conditions and be able to close as quickly.  

 3) The idea of coupling the other India assets with the E&P is a good 
strategy if your goal is to ultimately sale, but time is unimportant.   I've 
done multi-asset deals before with a major and the bureaucracy rivals India.  
The due diligence on the multiple assets will eliminate any chance of closing 
this year. In fact, I would be surprised if we could even get a PSA signed 
before year-end on a multi-asset deal, plus the gov't approvals become more 
complex.  

 If the goal is money in the door before 12/31/00,  I favor a buy/sell at 
Ken's number.  If we go to October and don't get the documents in place we 
really haven't lost anything because there is little likelihood of closing 
under a traditional scenario even if we start today.   We will prepare our 
dataroom while the negotiations on the documents take place and be ready to 
bring in bidders by October. If we buy at these numbers I believe we can flip 
the deal within 6-9 months if not sooner since we have operatorship, critical 
mass a major would covet, only one partner and Reliance is not a partner.  

Also,  If we elect to go to a traditional auction, I would strongly suggest 
we keep the E&P separate from the other India assets, at least initially, to 
run the auction with the best chance of getting a PSA signed before 
year-end.   We can always combine them at a later date during negotiations 
once we see how the process is going.  Too many pieces right out of the box 
will be very cumbersome and time consuming.  If we have to combine them to 
get interest, we can do it as we see the need for an enhancement.
 

My final thought, if we do an outright sale to RIL ( not a pre-negotiated 
buy/sell with stipulated closing dates,,, etc.) they will want to do a 
certain amount of due diligence and rightfully so.   They would expect and 
probably demand the same considerations as any other buyer including a 
dataroom visit to pick our brains one more time.  Again this becomes a time 
issue!!  Under the buy/sell scenario we have devised, there is no due 
diligence period, the structure of the deal is stipulated and everything is 
handled via representations and warranties in the pre-negotiated PSA.     


Let me know how and when you wish to proceed.   I will pursue with complete 
dedication whichever option you select.

Thanks for the time to share my thoughts,

Good morning, Michelle -

Ken Lay said that he would be happy to be the opening keynote speaker at
the kick off luncheon on Wednesday, April 25, 2001.

Sorry for the delay, but at least we are sure he wants to do it.

Hi Rosalee-- I just wanted to thank you so much for your extra help on our
inquiry to Ken.  We understand completely that the April 25 slot following
his return from vacation is not the most ideal arrangement.  I think it's
always easiest for someone like him if he knows that a speech given
recently
can easily serve as the basis for a new request.  I wanted to remind you of
my previous suggestion that his keynote presentation in Montreal last May
to
the World Forum on Energy Regulation would accomplish most of that, and we
would work with Rob and others to minimize any effort required to add new
content.  Hopefully, this will help with the decision this week.  As I
mentioned the other day, Ken is really the most authoritative figure when
it
comes to the idea that economic concepts can be used to build energy
markets
and business enterprises that lead to better societies!  Talk soon, and
don't hesitate to ever ask for a ""quid pro quo"" from us.

I'm sorry that we didn't discuss dates this morning as Mr. Lay is on vacation

several weeks, it is already pretty booked up. 

I will certainly share this e-mail with him.  Is it possible to update Mr.

I would like to schedule a short meeting in your office to  share the 
remarkable progress that the Committee to Encourage Corporate  Philanthropy 
is making and to ask that you consider hosting a meeting for  ten to fifteen 
CEOs of other major Houston corporations to encourage their  participation in 
the only forum of CEOs focused on the agenda of corporate  giving.
?
I'm anxious to meet you as we have so many friends in  common: three of your 
directors, John Duncan, Pug Winokur and Norm Blake, and  the Slocums, to name 
just a few.
?
I look forward to hearing from you.

P.S. If it works in your schedule, I'm available to come  to Houston on 
August 28 or 29 or anytime the week of September  4.

MU alumnus, Roger Vasey.  In the letter, Roger outlines a business
opportunity that he believes has a potential synergy with Enron.

While I am not familiar with this business opportunity, I am very familiar
with Roger.  He is now semi-retired following a very successful business
career.  He remains a special advisor to the chairman of Merrill Lynch &
Co., Inc., in New York.  Previously, he was executive VP and global director
of all debt markets underwriting, sales, and trading for the firm.

Since the early 1990s, Roger has been actively involved with MU,
specifically with the College of Business.  He has served as chair of both
the Strategic Development Board and the Davenport Society.  Roger also was a
member of the steering committee for the college's very successful capital
campaign.  I hold him in the highest regard and feel fortunate that he, like
you, has chosen to contribute to his undergraduate alma mater in various
significant ways.

I hope you will consider the opportunity described in Roger's letter.  I
know he must think it has a great deal of potential if he decided to present
it to you.

Finally, thanks very much for your holiday card and the donation
opportunity, which benefitted Boys & Girls Club of Columbia in my case.
Season's greetings,

Mr. Kase Lawal about a potential sale of Mariner or with the economics of the 
aborted IPO.  His $250 M valuation may have been appropriate 12 to 18 months 
ago.  However, Mariner has enjoyed a series of successful wells that are 
expected to be booked in reserve reports next March not to mention 
significant increases in gas and oil prices.  Our current valuations, in the 
$600M range is a stretch target but not incredibly out of line given reserve 
growth and current energy prices.  Our current goal, is to be able to 
demonstrate three to four quarters of increasing operating cashflow and 
reserves growth before attempting a private sale mid next year to a 
significant E&P concern that desires an offshore division.  The 
concentration, operating and exploration risk implicit in Mariner make it a 
very poor IPO candidate ((ie) I'm not sure that an IPO was ever a viable 
strategy to maximize the exit value).

I would recommend that we not meet to make the following points:
 a) Mariner is not on the market at this point in time and
 b)  his un-solicited offer does not warrant serious attention.

Otherwise, we would be glad to speak to him in the future if we decide to 
sell tha asset.

I hope this meets with your approval.

(Ken Lay bio for Davenport program)

Kenneth L. Lay is the chairman and CEO of Enron, based in Houston, Texas.
Enron, one of the largest integrated natural gas and electricity companies
in the world, operates one of the world's largest natural gas transmission
systems and is the world's largest supplier of electricity and natural gas
in North America. Under Lay's leadership, the company has grown to $31
billion in annual revenues. For the past four years, Fortune magazine has
named Enron the most innovative company in America.

Lay, a Missouri native, earned bachelor's and master's degrees from MU in
1964 and 1965, respectively, garnering Phi Beta Kappa distinction as an
undergraduate. He completed a PhD degree in economics from the University of
Houston in 1970.

After serving as an officer in the U.S. Navy, Lay joined Pinkney Walker as
his technical assistant in Washington, D.C., in the early 1970s. At that
time, Walker had just been appointed a commissioner of the Federal Power
Commission. Lay later served as deputy undersecretary of the U.S. Department
of Interior.

Lay is a member of the President's Council on Sustainable Development, the
Business Council, the National Petroleum Council and the American Enterprise
Institute. He is a member of the board of trustees of the H. John Heinz III
Center for Science, Economics, and the Environment. He is also a director
for Compaq Computer Corp., Eli Lilly and Co., and Trust Company of the West.

Lay received the college's Alumni Citation of Merit in 1990 and an honorary
Doctor of Law degree from MU in 1992. He received the Private Sector
Council's 1997 Leadership Award, was inducted into the Texas Business Hall
of Fame in 1997, and was presented a Horatio Alger Award in 1998.

I'd like to thank you for your continued participation in this project.

I thought it would make sense to quickly recap where we are following last
week's meeting.

1. We will redraft the report to reflect several trains of thought.  We
will, for example, express a greater appreciation for the fact that there
are major problems with the current financial reporting framework, a big gap
between GAAP and the real world in which investors must make their
judgements.  We will devote much more attention to the issue of intangibles,
including the need for a common language to describe them.  We will
elaborate on the issue of the environment for disclosure, suggesting that we
need a way of thinking about the concept of safe harbor, one which is based
on the notion that the way to protect investors amid so much uncertainty is
to make it easier for companies to provide forward looking information,
knowing that no one can be fully confident of any projections these days.
We will be much bolder in recommending several groups - the SEC, FASB,
institutional investors - take a much greater interest in the deficiencies
of the reporting model and ask the questions, commission the studies, etc.

All of this will still be within the framework of the spirit of the last
draft - that is, we're against more regulation at this time, against
prescriptive one-size-fits-all mandates, etc.  And we believe that the
market is forcing disclosure already - but maybe not quickly or
comprehensively enough.

2. Some of the panel members will have supplementary views.  Can you
begin to put pen to paper now?  Here is my speculation as to who may want to
say what:

* Len Baker and Rob Glaser may wish to write something on the recent
""Fair Disclosure"" decision.  I sense that Dennis Powell might wish to join.
Len, can you take the lead?  I'd suggest no more than one page, preferably
half a page.

* John Neff may wish to express skepticism about the value of
developing a new language for intangibles.

* John Doerr and Len Baker may wish to say something about accounting
for pooling or stock options.  Again, please keep it very short.  John, can
you take the lead?

If anyone else is thinking about a supplementary view, please let me know.
We would appreciate these submissions by October 15.

3. Future Schedule.  We agreed to ""get it right"" and not to stop until
we do.   The next steps, it seems to me are:

* Get you a new draft
* Get your views either in a meeting or conference call to be
scheduled
* See where we are then

However, I'd like to suggest that we aim to finish this report by December
15, 2000 if at all possible.

Please let me know if I've missed anything or if you have additional ideas.

Best regards,
Jeff

Subject: Selection Of My Successor-My Concern

Ken: I have ""heard"" from two sources in this office that Enron will announce 
my successor today. I have not been advised of the selection and am concerned 
that this announcement will not treat my retirement in an appropriate and 
deserving manner.

I have placed calls to Steve Kean since hearing this rumor but have not 
received a response as of now. Admittedl, our phone service because of the 
office construction is not totally functioning.

Frankly, I think this matter has not been handled in a caring way and I have 
been acccused of giving information on the selection to Tom DeLay which is 
untrue. My office mates are all more aware of the candidates and their status 
than I have been.

I regret having to contact you on this matter but feel that despite my total 
cooperation, allegiance and dedication to Enron, I am not being treated with 
the courtesy and sensitivity that this matter deserves.

Subject: Executive Forum's

During our previous executive forums, interest was expressed in holding a 
forum in London for executives who have participated in the Executive Program 
and are based in the UK.  Mary Clark indicates that you will be in London the 
end of this month for an employee meeting.  Following are the names of the 
Enron Europe executives who have participated in the Executive Program to 
date:

Kevin Beasley
Eric Gadd
Eric Gonzales
Matthew Scrimshaw
Brian Stanley
Steve Young
Gregory Cardenas

They will be receiving invitations to the Executive Forums scheduled here in 
Houston over the next few months.  But, I would be happy to invite them to a 
special Executive Forum, specifically for them, in London while you are 
there, your schedules permitting.  Please let me know if you would like me to 
try to arrange this.

contribution requests.

Tom Delay's Request -- We did fulfill the $10,000 request that came to us 
from Tom and Christine Delay for the Fort Bend Child Advocates.  In addition, 
we've arranged with Heather for your family's foundation to match Enron's 
gift.  I spoke directly with Christine Delay several times and they are very 
appreciative of the gifts and our efforts to correct the initial oversight.

YMCA --  I've had multiple conversations with Heather about a combined 
Enron/Lay Family contribution to the YMCA.  According to Heather, you and 
Linda have agreed to contribute $500,000 and ask that Enron match.  We are, 
of course, willing to do that.  I am scheduling a meeting with Bill Phillips 
of the YMCA to discuss the gift.  We will be talking to him about naming 
opportunities as well as the YMCA's consideration of extending services to 
Enron employees at the downtown YMCA, as well as outlying facilities.  (FYI:  
The downtown YMCA recently chose to cancel the agreement we'd had with them 
allowing Body Shop members to utilize the facility.)

Other Capital Campaigns -- We are currently evaluating several other capital 
contribution requests.  Each is outlined below.  We are proceeding in several 
ways.  First, I am scheduling a meeting with Marty Sunde to discuss EES's 
interest in pursuing energy service agreements with these not-for-profit 
institutions.  As you know, EES is focusing its current efforts on much 
larger scale energy portfolios.  Secondly, I am working to evaluate these 
requests based on the leveraging opportunities associated with each.  
Finally, we want to be equitable in our giving to these local campaigns as 
well as consistent in our giving philosophy.  We are working to balance these 
requests relative to each other and to our goal to transfer dollars away from 
multi-year gifts toward programs.

Texas Heart Institute -- I had breakfast yesterday with Bob Devlin, Dr. 
Denton Cooley, Jack Doherty and Meredith Long.  They shared with me plans for 
a new Texas Heart Institute building in the Medical Center.  (The building 
will bear a striking resemblance to our buildings -- oval in shape and bluish 
glass.)  They are conducting a $75 million campaign -- $42 million to build 
and equip the building and $33 million to sustain programs in research and 
education.  They are requesting $1 million from Enron and will allow us to 
specify how the gift is spent.  American General and Shell Oil Foundation 
have each contributed $1 million

Baylor College of Medicine -- Amy Lee and I had lunch last week with several 
folks from Baylor.  They are in the midst of a campaign to fund their many 
programs in research and education.  We discussed opportunities to expand our 
existing medical-based literacy program - Prescription for Reading.  They 
also outlined for us numerous other sponsorship opportunities.  No specific 
dollar amount was requested.  While several pharmaceutical companies have 
contributed in the $500,000 to $1 million range, most of our local peers are 
within the $100,000 to $500,000 range.

University of Houston - MD Anderson Library and the Honors College -- As you 
know, the University is requesting $500,000 from Enron over 5 years to 
support renovation of the library.  Since our call with Harriet Latimer, I've 
conducted some research to determine what other local corporations are 
contributing.  Currently, no companies have made a financial commitment.  In 
fact, only Compaq and Shell have committed at all with in-kind 
contributions.  While I am confident that we will support this in some way, I 
am particularly interested in speaking with Steve Barth and Chet Gladchuck at 
the University to determine if the library could be rolled into the energy 
services agreement we are currently evaluating with the University's athletic 
department.

On a separate note, you'd forwarded to me a request from the University to 
fund a publication ""The Future of International Education:  Directions & 
Opportunities.""  Elyse Kalmans discussed this with her contacts at U of H.  
They indicated that this was not a high priority for them and would rather 
have Enron commit its resources to other University endeavors, such as the 
library.  We have chosen to decline this request.

I apologize for the length of this memo.  However, I did want to keep you 
updated on the status of these various requests.  I will present 
recommendations to you on each of these pending requests in the coming 
weeks.  In the meantime, if you have any questions or comments, please 
contact me.

Subject: Final Draft -- SEC Report on Valuation


  Attached please find the final draft.  Tim Koller and I hope
it reflects all the changes suggested on the last conference call.  Of
course, we will never be able to satisfy everyone to the last detail, but I
think we came as close as we will get.

  There is still some proof reading and minor editing to do,
and we are working on that even as we send this off.

  To the best of my knowledge there may now be two ""individual
views""  to go into what is now Attachment D.  Len Baker may feel that the
language on Safe Harbor doesn't go far enough.  Baruch Lev feels that the
SEC should not only issue a ""concept release"" to solicit broad public
comments on a ""supplementary framework for reporting intangibles,"" but it
should create a task force to do the work.  (Most of the group feels this
approach is too close to asking the SEC to mandate change.)  Baruch also
feels that in relying so much on voluntary disclosure, we are exaggerating
what companies will, in fact, disclose. My suggestion, Len and Baruch, is to
write a paragraph or two for Attachment D, if you wish.  Hopefully, both of
you will begin with a sentence supporting the report in general, but if you
feel strongly that the report doesn't reflect all your views, please do
state them for the record.

  Before we schedule a final call for last minute details,
etc,  I'd like to request an e-mail, fax or phone call from each of you
letting me know if you can sign-off on the report.  I'd appreciate this by
Monday, April 16th.

  Thanks a million.

  Best regards,
  Jeff

The following should give you some talking points and background:

 Stedman Graham is most noted for being the companion to Oprah Winfrey, 
however he is CEO of two firms which are in the marketing and educational 
consulting business.

 Enron has been discussing using Graham's consulting services for our 
Associate program to focus on leadership training and develop.

 We are considering him as a potential advisory board member for Enron 
Investment Partners.  This will be our first meeting with him so we are not 
yet ready to propose a board seat yet.

 We also hope that any relationship we develop with him could lead to a 
connection with Oprah Winfrey for the purpose of further expanding the 
publicity for EIP and Enron and also to  access additional investment dollars.

 Prior to your meeting we will have introduced him to EIP and Enron so he 
should be well briefed on the company.  I think it would be good if you could 
focus on the activities of EIP and the reason why Enron would be supportive 
of this type of business since that is always a question that comes up.  I 
understand that Linda will join us during the meeting and want to talk about 
the Holocaust Museum and Oprah's potential involvement with it.

 Also with us will be Danny Lawson whom you have met.  Danny was the mayor's  
chief fund raiser for the last two elections and is very active locally.  
Last Friday Danny facilitated a meeting between EES and Jew Don Boney for the 
purpose of moving along the potential energy services contract between EES 
and the city of Houston.  He has been a strong supporter of ours for quite 
some time and is also a candidate for the advisory board.  Danny currently 
sets on the Cynet board.

 Please let me know if there is any other information that would be useful

Subject:  Invitation to deliver 2001 IAEE conference keynote


Dear Ken:

Next April 25-27, 2001, Houston will host the 24th conference of the
International Association for Energy Economics, in combination with the
annual meeting of our U.S. Association for Energy Economics affiliate.  We
invite you to serve as our opening keynote speaker at the kick off luncheon
on Wednesday, April 25 to help set the tone, goals and objectives for this
event.

Our theme is ""2001: An Energy Odyssey."" We are using the conference to
showcase the role of economics in developing markets for energy, and to
deal with issues that impede, or facilitate, market development as well as
enterprise strategy and metamorphosis.  We can think of no one better to
clearly define these major themes and priorities than you.

I was a speaker and delegate at the World Forum on Energy Regulation in
Montreal last May, and greatly enjoyed your luncheon keynote (and hope that
the regulators and policy makers attending the Forum took your key points
to
heart).  The thoughts you offered -- on the importance of standards, the
opportunities to build network platforms and Enron's own experience, are of
vital importance to IAEE/USAEE members.  We would ask you to include
comments on the fundamental importance of economic principles in both
guiding market development and the efforts of those of us who operate in
markets on behalf of enterprises.

The IAEE remains the largest worldwide combination of industry, business
and
university interests engaged in energy development and policy.  To bring
you
up-to-date on the association, our Web site is www.iaee.org. I'm sure
Rosilea will have someone on her staff pull the relevant materials together
for you. I have also included the call for papers for the Houston
conference
(at the end of this mail) which lines out the major sessions and topics. In
addition to our invitation to you, we are inviting Mark Moody-Stuart of
RD/Shell for the April 26 keynote luncheon to address environmental issues
and Rilwanu Lukman, Secretary General of OPEC (and a member of IAEE), in a
joint session with the Board of Directors of the Offshore Technology
Conference on Friday, to cover worldwide outlooks for oil and gas.

Finally, as you know, Enron Corp. for some time has been a corporate
sponsor of our UH Energy Institute and the previous Natural Gas Project,
which you helped to found.  Thus, we also are relying on Rob Bradley to
help
identify and implement the major environmental themes for the plenary
session, ""Sustaining Development"" (yes, we indeed are trying to turn
thinking around with our re-phrasing).

I hope to hear from Rosilea soon on your interest and availability.  We
look forward to having you with us next April!

the roll over, but not the referendum.  You may need to make a call to
Marathon to see if you can convince them on the referendum.  Conoco also
only committed to their proportionate part, probably about $50,000, for the
referendum and Don Sanders said he would commit $50,000 toward the
referendum.  We, therefore could have only $1 million from the partners on
the referendum if Marathon, Texaco and BFI don't contribute.  We do have
$100,000, however, from Reliant.  Moreover, without Sanders, BFI and
possibly Texaco, we may have only around $30 million to rollover into the
loan.  As soon as we can the final answers from all of the partners we will
be able to finalize the term sheet with the Sports Authority and get the
advance payment on the loan.  I still haven't heard from Goldberg on the

Thank you for your communication advising as to the concern that the IRS
seems to have about non-profits and the internet.  In early February of
this year I filed a form 1023 seeking a tax determination letter for
""Technology For All"" a Texas non-profit corporation whose mission it is
to enhance the educational and economic opportunities of the
disadvantaged (""TFA"").  TFA has a strong board led by Ken Lay, the CEO
of Enron Corporation.  TFA has assisted its affiliates (all believed to
be tax exempt non profits) in building computer learning centers
(""CLC's"") where recycled computers and donated software are connected
over the Enron Broadband Network (donated to TFA) to a server farm that
delivers to the disadvantaged at the CLC's educational and other
content.  There are over 75 CLC's in Houston, some 25 in Colorado and we
are building affiliations that will build them across the country and
eventually all over the world.  The business plan for this contemplates
operations in excess of one billion by the end of five years.  However,
we have not yet received our tax determination letter.  We have found
that major contributors require a tax determination letter.

    I received a response from the IRS on May 3, 2000.  On May 11, 2000,
I responded with answers to the inquiries made by the IRS.  Then on June
8 I was advised that our application had been sent to the national
office.  On November 15 I received another letter from the IRS raising
some additional questions unrelated to the first response.  While there
were some that were of substance in the main they were pretty weak.  The
first question was something like ""What did we mean by disadvantaged?""

    My question to you is what do you think is best to get this going
and out of the IRS?  Should I ask our board members to use their
considerable political influence tocause the IRS to move this?  Back in
August I had Bill Archer give the Commissioner an invitation to finish
this.  It did not seem to work.  I do not wish for an effort on my part
to cause this to go to the bottom of some bureaucrats stack.     Your
advice would be appreciated.

Jack Clark",LAY-K

I have invited the following individuals to join us at the 3 pm Thursday 
meeting to review the draft of your Columbus speech on the natural gas 
situation.

Hamd Alhkayat--Hamd has replaced Andrew Miles in the rotation and will be 
helping me with your presentations as well as being the lead with Jeff's 
speeches.

Shelley Corman--Shelley has been developing messages for the current and 
anticipated gas situation and pipeline safety for the gas pipeline group.  
(The safety issue could come up in your Q&A.)

Stinson Gibner--Stinson is with the research group that has generated some of 
the more complex slides in your draft dealing with volatility and historic 
futures pricing.

Gil Muhl--Gil markets gas products to customers and is speaking at an AGA 
conference on the gas supply and price situation the day before your talk.  
His group is focusing on new products to help end-users with winter 
volatility.  I have asked Gil to send you his presentation as well for the 
meeting.

Back to your presentation (the draft slides of which I am delivering to you 
today), Dan Yergin thought it would be appropriate for you to give an 
overview of the situation as the ""teacher"" or ""professor.""  Some questions 
that you could address would include:

Where has the industry come from, and what lessons have we learned?

How is the business different today?

What public policy conclusions are implicit in this history?

I think our comparative advantage over the specialists who will be presenting 
before and after your keynote is that you have ""been there"" in the evolution 
of the natural gas market, and Enron is at the forefront of helping customers 
deal with price and supply uncertainty.  There is also a good opportunity to 
stress the need for new industry ""best practices"" (more hedging) and the 
right public policies to deal with this issue (from ""do no harm"" to expanding 
incentives in the market).

First - congratulations on your year 2000 to date. From what I have
researched, Enron is an incredible organization of products, services and
people.

I represent MobileStar - the worlds largest public Wireless Lan company.
Based in Dallas, and private at this time - we have built and will continue
to build a WIFI IEEE 802.11b lan network in public places such as hotels,
airports, airline clubs and retail/coffee house type places where mobile
users go, eat, move, meet and sleep.  You will find us today in many
Marriotts, Hiltons, Sheratons and American Airline Admiral club rooms-
offering unteathered T-1 speed connectivity to a company lan or the
internet.

We are soon to launch Hong Kong Int Airport and the London airports as well.
We also have a confidential network partner/s in the works to be announced
in the next 30 days that will take our public network to over 5000 locations
in the next 2 years. You will be interested I assure you.

I feel that not only is MobileStar a service that could benefit your mobile
global staff that travels both domestically, locally and internationally,
but also a partner tie in terms of content delivery, possible backbone
partnerships and video/Blockbuster delivery to a MobileStar subscribers
handheld, Ipaq computer or laptop.

I would very much like the opportunity to meet with both your IT team whom
investigates wireless applications and services for your personnel as well
as a member of your Broadband Development team.

Also - I will offer you a FREE trial subscription to our network for  your
travels.

I thank you for your time.

PS - We are heading into Series C funding..........

Regards,

Kevin

I have been assisting John Watson with his representation of Sports
Facilities, L.P., and I am in the process of coordinating the $1.4 million
prepayment by the Sports Authority and the contribution of such amount by
the partners to the referendum campaign.

Assuming that we receive the prepayment from the Sports Authority, we expect
to be able to start making contributions to the referendum campaign this
week.  The contributions will be paid to the referendum campaign by the
partnership, on behalf of each partner, upon receipt of instructions from
each such partner that its share of the amount prepaid should be contributed
to the campaign instead of being distributed.  I have discussed this
procedure with Sue Walden.

With respect to your arrangement with Shell, we were not sure what you and
Shell had agreed to.  The monies being contributed to the referendum
campaign are being contributed to a special purpose political action
committee (as required by law).  This special purpose PAC is subject to the
general Texas laws that govern campaign fundraising.  As you know, one of
these laws provides that ""a person may not knowingly make or authorize a
political contribution in the name of or on behalf of another unless the
person discloses in writing to the recipient the name and address of the
person actually making the contribution . . . .""   Pending a better
understanding of the Shell arrangement, we will hold Shell's $100,000 in the
partnership's account.

Please contact John Watson at 713-758-2556 or me at 713-758-2350 if you have
any questions regarding the foregoing.

The attached one pager describes an embryonic idea for a new philanthropy 
venture that might be of interest for your panel discussion with Michael Dell 
at the Fortune conference on October 12th.

It is inspired by the populist arguments on the campaign trail against 
partial social security privatization.  I believe that if a greater number of 
Americans were corporate investors there would be a greater buy in to not 
only social security reform but to sound economic policies.  I also believe 
that redistributionist arguments would carry less weight.

Meeting"" on Friday May 18.  
Based on very positive responses, we expect participation from a number of 
commercial groups from within Enron -- including Enron Europe, EES, ENA, ETS, 
EGM and others.

The meeting will be held from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. (including lunch) in room 
8C1, 8th floor of the Enron Building.  (Representatives of Enron Europe will 
participate in the morning session by video conference, and others from 
various locations will participate by telephone.)

The objectives of the session are to:

1) provide Enron commercial and support groups with the latest information on 
emissions regulation, markets, and Enron's advocacy efforts worldwide, and

2) receive feedback on commercial interests and input on policy options so 
that we may develop the best business and policy strategies for Enron in both 
the short and long term.

We would like you to invite you to join the session for as long as your 
schedule permits, as well as make a few brief remarks about the importance of 
global emissions issues -- such as climate change and U.S. multipollutant 
legislation -- to the group.

We are still preparing a detailed agenda, but expect to cover a number of 
topics related to U.S. and international emissions issues.  A draft is 
attached.

I hope you will be able to join us for what should be a very insightful and 
productive session.

Rosalee:  please let me know of potentially-available times for Dr. Lay's 
participation at your earliest convenience.

Thank you,

Freedom of Press 'under threat' in Russia, campaigners claim

Russia's provincial media is struggling to maintain its freedoms in the face
of politically motivated assaults, campaigners claim.

Oleg Panfilov, chief of the Centre for Journalism in Extreme Situations,
said: ""A new state propaganda machine is being created in the federal
districts, with new state-run newspapers, new state-run news agencies, new
state-run TV channels.""

Fyodor Penkin, chief editor of the Volga Times, who survived a shotgun
attempt on his life earlier this year, said: ""Ten years ago, when I was
creating this newspaper, I felt for the first time that I can write freely.
Now this child I have created is dying before my eyes.""

Media's role in Ghana's presidential election praised

Ghana's acting ambassador to the US has offered a glowing account of the
role played by his country's media in the recent presidential election.

Francis Tsegah said radio in particular played a significant part in
ensuring the success of the election - Ghana's first multi-party one.

He said:  ""The press covered the parties and were able to send information
to the public in such a way that by the time you had the election there was
no longer any question of the media being biased towards one party.""

The election was won by opposition candidate John Kufuor.

Widow of murdered Ukrainian journalist abandons ""na<ve"" search for truth

The widow of murdered Ukrainian journalist Georgiy Gongadze told how she has
despaired of ever uncovering the truth about his death.

Myroslava Gongadze said her ""endless moves"" to find out what happened to her
husband were ""na<ve"".

The journalist's headless body was found near Kiev. Gongadze was a fierce
critic of the Ukrainian government, which has been implicated in his death.

Malaysia increases pressure on media

Malaysia has increased pressure on both foreign and domestic media, by
branding people involved in award-winning news site Malaysiakini.com
""traitors"" and delaying the distribution of the latest issues of Asiaweek
and the Far Eastern Economic Review (FEER).

Prime minister Mahathir Mohamad said of Malaysiakini: ""People who love
Malaysia would not support Malaysiakini. Previously people would say
traitors but these people really behave like traitors, asking foreigners to
harm their own country.""

Two Asiaweek issues and one of FEER - all carrying articles on Malaysia -
were stuck in distributions depots, and FEER Managing Editor Michael
Vatikiotis said: ""We have no indication as to whether this is just a one off
or part of a policy. We have had no official communication.""

Asiaweek is part of the AOL-Time Warner stable, and FEER part of Dow Jones.

Taiwan vows to safeguard free speech over controversial book

Taiwan's President Chen Shui-ban has vowed to safeguard the island's freedom
of speech as a row over a controversial Japanese comic book continued to
divide the state.

The book claimed that many Taiwanese women, forced to act as sex slaves to
Japanese soldiers during World War Two, were volunteers. Some politicians
demanded the cartoonist be denied a visa to visit Taiwan while others
insisted that he be allowed his freedom of speech.

empire's output by better integrating its disparate parts, and ""getting
below the hype"".

In an interview with The Times' media editor, Ray Snoddy, Sambrook, who
officially takes the director's chair this week from the departing Tony
Hall, says he is running a ""fantastic operation"". But, he admits, it
""misfires slightly as we go down the road. We do not quite pack the punches
that we ought to"".

Sambrook says he has discussed how best to coordinate journalists in the UK
regions, and World Service, with senior BBC executives.

Broadcasters face curbs in Singapore

Foreign broadcasters who ""engage in the domestic politics of Singapore""
could soon face restrictions.

Information and Arts Minister Lee Yock Suan said he was set to introduce a
bill that would allow the government to restrict distribution of a broadcast
service if the company was deemed to be meddling in the city-state's
internal affairs.

Singapore's Newspaper Act can ban distribution of a newspaper or magazine
and has been used against The Economist and Asian Wall Street Journal, but
up until now broadcasters have been left alone.

Lee said foreign media operated in Singapore as a matter of privilege, not
of right.

He added: ""Our aim is not to ban information but to restrict subscriber and
advertising revenue to an errant channel.""

Australia's ABC must decentralise to lessen Sydney bias, MD says

The Australian Broadcasting Corporation must decentralise both staff and
activities to prevent it from becoming a Sydney mouthpiece, managing
director Jonathan Shier said.

Shier said that by June 2003, the ABC wanted to increase its
non-news/current affairs production in centres other than Sydney or
Melbourne by 40 percent.

He also said that the internet had its place within media and should not be
sidelined just because of the recent dot com gloom.

Unions claim that the decentralisation talk is just a ""stalking horse for
getting rid of staff"".

Journalist Ware reportedly offered safe house by BBC

The BBC has reportedly offered a safe house to Panorama reporter John Ware,
the journalist most closely associated with the expose on the Omagh bombing.

According to the Times newspaper, the Corporation has also offered Ware
personal protection.

The bomb blast outside the BBC's west London centre is being blamed on the
Real IRA, who may have acted in revenge over the Panorama reports.

Meanwhile, speculation that the BBC might move flagship current affairs
programme Panorama back to a weekday slot - but on BBC2 - refuses to go
away.

MediaGuardian quotes an 'insider' as saying: ""Sunday may just have been a
transition. If it moved to a weekday slot, possibly even to BBC2, it would
increase its audience and get more share.""

The BBC has insisted that Panorama will remain in its Sunday night slot,
despite opposition from some prominent figures, including Ware.

Indonesian copies of Time censored by distributor

The Indonesian distributor of Time Magazine censored pictures of headless
corpses -victims of the ethnic bloodshed in Indonesia's Central Kalimantan
province - in the Asian edition of the magazine, as he feared it would
incite more violence.

The front cover image and photographs inside the magazine, where decapitated
bodies were shown, were blacked out by hand in all copies being sent to
Indonesia. The distributor said it had not come under pressure from the
government to censor the pictures.

Time journalist Jason Tedjasukmana said he was concerned that the move could
lead to other companies taking censorship into their own hands.

UK broadcasters on guard against online poll rigging in Election run-up

The UK's top broadcasters have pledged to be on alert for attempts by
political activists to rig online polls in the run up the General Election.

The BBC's assistant director of news Mark Damazer told how the Corporation
had ran a poll during its Europe week coverage, only to inadvertently
receive an e-mail from a pressure group asking its supporters to '""keep
e-mailing this site, we need to get in as many votes as we can"".

And ITN's editor-in-chief Richard Tait said: ""We are going to be extremely
careful not to allow any online polling to be hijacked by an individual
group.""

citizen of the US.

I've been a Houston-based employee of Enron for nearly 10 years, of which 
seven were with the Dabhol project.  I obtained my green card in 1992, which 
entitled me to apply for US citizenship in 1997.  I recently went through the 
final interview and was awaiting a call to take oath.

Instead, the INS denied my application for citizenship on grounds of my 
extensive travel.  This, despite the fact that:

(1).  A disqualification can be made only if an applicant is 

- out of the country for a continuous period of six months; or
- is out of the country for more than 30 months in the sixty month period 
after the green card.  (Neither of these apply to me).

(2).  I had filed a notification to the INS immediately after getting my 
green card (in 1992) informing them that I will be travelling extensively on 
business.  Filing this notification allows me to travel without the 
restrictions mentioned above.

Ken, I need your help on two fronts:

(1).  Support in filing an appeal to the INS.  This will cost an outside 
counsel between $1500-$3000.

(2).  Request my US Representative Mr.DeLay to send the attached letter to 
the local INS administrator.

I believe this will clear the way for my becoming a citizen of the US, to 
which I eagerly look forward.

Ken-I have revised the term sheet provided to us by George yesterday along
the lines that you suggested to give the partners somewhat stronger rights
on the choice of seats and suites.  These rights are not as strong as the
rights the Partnership got from the Astros, but I hope they will be
considered sufficient by the partners.  I received an e-mail yesterday from
Conoco reiterating Archie's concern on the preferential rights.  So far, all
of the partners  I've heard from on the financing term sheet are OK with it.
However, I haven't yet heard from Ric Campo on the financing term sheet.

Energy: Tony believes incentives to production should remain a priority,=20
including incentives for new drilling through severance tax credits and=20
exemptions in certain cases.=20

On the natural gas front, rising prices and tightening supplies were the=20
focus of Tony=01,s recent letter to state and federal leaders.? With natura=
l gas=20
price hitting an all-time high, it=01,s estimated that the average Texas=20
household could see a 55 percent increase in their home heating bills this=
=20
winter.? To minimize the impact of such an increase, Tony offered some=20
practical advice for Texans.? Read about it at=20
http://www.rrc.state.tx.us/commissioners/garza/garza.html.=20

Environment: Tony continues to lead the charge for stronger protection of o=
ur=20
state=01,s natural resources =01) especially water.? In the 77th Legislativ=
e=20
Session, Tony wants to build upon the Commission=01,s commitment to the=20
preservation of Texas=01, natural resources by refining methods to increase=
=20
funding for the state=01,s Oil Field Clean-up Fund.=20

Tony also wants to ensure that Texas is safe for us and for future=20
generations.? You may have seen reports of the pipeline explosion in Abilen=
e=20
or coverage of the proposed Longhorn Pipeline in Central Texas.? Both are=
=20
examples of the public and media becoming more concerned with pipeline=20

Efficiency: This year, the Commission rolled out the first stage of its=20
Electronic Compliance and Approval Program =01) allowing Texas oil and gas=

Editorial - TEACHING AN OLD INDUSTRY NEW TRICKS VIA THE INTERNET

The concept of =01&E-learning=018 is basically an old idea that has come ba=
ck into
vogue with the never-ending possibilities offered by the World Wide Web.
From training employees to collaborating and sharing information with
business partners and suppliers, today=01,s businesses are utilizing web
technology to broaden their share of the market.

Uday Om Pabrai calls E-learning the Internet=01,s =01&next killer applicati=
on.=018
Pabrai is a longtime web-watcher, having founded Net Guru Technologies in
1992, and having created the first webmaster certification
standard-Certified Internet Webmaster. He is now chairman of the AIP
Certification and Accreditation Council.

The energy industry, though cautious about utilizing the web, is scrambling
to take advantage of this next big thing.  Recently, several top companies
have taken the plunge to hire Internet professionals to develop their own
virtual training programs.

Equiva Services LLC, a joint venture company formed by Texaco Inc., Shell
Oil Company and Saudi Refining, Inc, ABB Vetco Gray, and Columbia Gulf
Transmission Company, have all recently jumped on the e-learning bandwagon.
All three companies have created web-based platforms or e-commerce hubs tha=
t
enable employees to quickly and conveniently get necessary training from
pre-selected suppliers.

=01&This type of innovative application of information technology will help=
 us
to work smarter and faster for our internal clients,=018 said Mari Duarte,
senior human resources generalist for ABB Vetco Gray.  =01&We expect to low=
er
costs and improve efficiency by reducing the time of administrative
transactions related to registration and by improving reporting of
information related to training activities to management.=018

For the energy industry, E-learning can involve both the automation of
training management systems as well as the transmission and delivery of
learning to individuals through use of the Internet.  Through this
technology, training information previously available through classroom
instruction can be delivered directly to employees=01, desktops in differen=
t
forms, ranging from basic presentation-style courses to highly interactive
courses with digitized video transmissions and on-line discussions.

=01&E-learning can encompass training employees and it can be used to share
important knowledge across the organization and with outside business
partners,=018 said Dennis McMullin, energy industry consultant at Proxicom,=
 a
leading Internet consulting firm in Houston, Texas.  McMullin says that mor=
e
companies are increasing the amount of training they offer online to help
employees stay current on market trends and personal skills.  =01&There can=
 be
a significant cost savings involved in using technology for learning, but a
company=01,s success ultimately depends on how effectively it can bring the
technology into the organization and how well they use it.=018

E-learning technology can also ease the administrative burden on an
organization=01,s human resources department and lower the per-unit cost of
training employees.  Additionally, management has the ability to better
analyze training needs and how to best deploy the information.  =01&Web-bas=
ed
training is extremely flexible and offers employees convenience in
scheduling courses when they need and want them,=018 said McMullin.  =01&It=
 also
allows them the opportunity to go back and revisit course material if the
need a refresher or a resource.  It is a self-teaching method that lets
individuals learn at their own pace and based on their own needs.""

Internet companies such as VerticalNet, Inc. in Horsham, PA, offer companie=
s
the ability to manage training programs through an Internet interface that
directly links the company with training suppliers.  Taken one stop further=
,
VerticalNet=01,s =01&Training Intelligence Portals=018 enable companies to =
centralize
their personnel training programs and literally outsource administration an=
d
other back-office transactions such as invoice management, utilization
reporting, course evaluation and quality assurance.

According to Walter Rogers, VerticalNet=01,s eBusiness training services se=
nior
director and general manager, the energy industry is becoming more
aggressive in moving from office administration and classroom learning to
web-based technology for training.  =01&We=01,re seeing a lot more demand f=
rom the
energy sector for e-learning technology,=018 said Rogers, whose firm is
currently working with several large energy companies.  =01&We=01,ve found =
that
the energy industry doesn=01,t typically lead the way in the use of technol=
ogy.
It tends to want to see it working and proven in other areas before they tr=
y
it.  But now they are getting more involved.  Since the industry is driven
to reduce operating costs, it finds this technology to be very cost
effective.=018

In addition to hiring Internet experts to develop and manage a training
site, Dennis McMullin points out that there is a large variety of existing
training opportunities for on-line learning.  =01&Most of the technology
companies offer on-line training for technical products, while numerous web
sites offer free information and opportunities for e-learning,=018 he said.

In the end, however, McMullin believes that acceptance of the Internet is
more than a technological issue for many companies, rather it requires a
cultural adjustment.  =01&It really is an issue of adjusting the company
culture to accept and benefit from Internet technology.  It requires
companies to be more open and less fearful of sharing information.  Energy
companies could really benefit from effective use of the Internet if they
use it as a median to share more knowledge throughout their organizations
and with suppliers.=018

CASE STUDY

Spare plant parts become manageable with Sparesfinder.com

One of the Internet=01,s most powerful features is its ability to make
information instantly available that once was virtually impossible to get.
That=01,s exactly the power behind sparesFinder.com, an Internet service th=
at
allows chemical, petroleum and power companies to manage their own
inventories of factory parts and search the inventories of other companies

E-mail is great.  I have copied Tori Wells on this also, as she works 
diligently on Dr. Lay's itineraries and Rob Bradley, who works on Dr. Lay's 
speeches.  We have virtually no information about the OECD Forum or the IEA 
Ministerial session except dates - May 15-16.  We have made reservations for 
Dr. & Mrs. Lay at the Bristol Hotel.  

We look forward to hearing from you.

Subject: for Rosalee - re Mr. Lay's participation at IEA ministerial


Rosalee --  I was given your name by Bill Ramsay as the person responsible
for co-ordinating Mr Lay's participation at the May IEA Ministerial session.
From the IEA side, I have been tasked with the responsibility for
co-ordinating not only parts of the Ministerial session, but also the
preceding OECD Forum -- in both of which Mr. Lay is scheduled.

I am hoping to be in closer communication with you to walk through our
current planning for these meetings, and to make sure that all our i's are
dotted and t's are crossed as we move toward May.  Please let me know
whether e-mail or a telephone call would be best.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Jonathan Pershing

1760,<8072761.1075840210338.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Thu, 21 Sep 2000 10:18:00 -0700 (PDT)",larry.izzo@enron.com,,EECC INSIDE ENRON,"Jeff, I understand at last week's PRC you asked Dick what the difference was 
between EECC, and, say, Brown and Root.  Let me try and answer that and at 
the same time provide my recommendations on how EECC should evolve inside the 
new Enron.

a. Enron does not ""need"" EECC; however, Enron has realized extra value from 
the EECC model since 1990.

b. EECC has taken an Enron liability (construction risk) and turned it into 
an asset (net income).  The risk was incurred by Enron's decision to build 
assets around the world.

c. Enron could have out-sourced most or all of its engineering and 
construction management since 1990; but for about the same market price and 
contract value, EECC has performed this work and accumulated over $250MM of 
net income for Enron.

d. In addition, EECC has performed the work generally in a manner superior to 
the rest of the industry.  We have avoided disasters experienced by Brown and 
Root, Black and Veatch, Snamprogetti, Raytheon, and Stone and Webster, which 
presumably could have occurred while performing Enron's work.  We've out 
performed them because we had better risk management skills.  

e. Cost avoidance:  In addition to performing this work at market price and 
at the same time making $250MM net income, as Jack Urquhart pointed out at 
the last Board meeting, we have avoided tens and tens of millions of dollars 
of extra cost during execution.  The Enron portfolio of construction risks 
averages in billions of dollars, so even 1 or 2 percent in nuisance-type 
change orders from outside contractors would have added up to substantial 
extra costs. 

f. ROIC:  as we recognized the Enron deal flow was decreasing, we were asked 
in the last two to three budget cycles to maintain or grow our net income.  
Therefore, we embarked on non-Enron third-party construction business.  This 
marginal income has increased our use of working capital.  Still, this year's 
return on all our working capital will be about $22%, down from 29% last 
year, but still a 25% average over two years which is not unreasonable.  You 
asked about the details of our working capital; I'm scheduled to brief you on 
2 Oct.
 
g. Internal flexibility:  there have been many instances over the years where 
having an internal contractor has enhanced the ability of an Enron developer 
to close the deal.  For example, on the 1999 Peakers, although other 
companies have out-sourced the same type of work, I assure you that because 
of the late start getting going by the Enron developers, having to out-source 
would of easily cost us four to six weeks of summer revenues on the 
schedule.  On our current Dabhol LNG project, an outside turnkey contractor 
would never be motivated to try and maintain the current schedule, given the 
weaknesses in the Owners' contractual positions, including quarry suitability 
and subsea surface rock surprises, etc.  Many other examples abound.

h. Downsizing risks:  I think the risk to Enron of what happens to a large 
EECC in the event of downsizing during a market cycle is misconceived.  EECC 
in Houston has about 350 employees, many of whom are accountants, lawyers, 
contract specialists, program managers,  all of whom have skill sets which 
are in demand in other Enron business units.  Therefore, any downsizing of 
EECC, if done over a reasonable period of time should be able to avoid a 
significant severance cost risk.

Nevertheless, as Enron changes to a less-asset dependent company, and because 
of the current value in monetizing assets, the need for change is necessary.  
I think it is important to agree on a clear plan and brief our employees, all 
of whom are stressed by the uncertainty of where they're going.  This will 
have a negative impact on the company's performance, unless addressed.

My recommendations for evolving EECC is as follows:

a. Sell NEPCO and phase out other non-Enron third-party lump sum work 
(already on-going).

b. Define a ""slice"" of EECC in Houston as ""NEPCO-Houston,"" and package this 
with the NEPCO sell.  A buyer might value the EECC-Houston expertise in 
cogeneration and gas-related services.

c. Finish the Enron work now under contract, which will take from one to two 
years.

d. Continue to self-perform any new Enron work in the future which I see 
centered in North America, Europe and possibly Brazil where assets may be 
required to enhance the Enron networks being developed for trading purposes.  
I think it would be a mistake to allow the decentralized business units to 
attempt to manage outside EPC contractors without a residual Center of 
Excellence (EECC).

e. Move EECC inside EES, allowing EES to take advantage of a continued income 
stream from EECC.  A subsequent step would be to merge the infrastructure 
between EES' Global Services and EECC.

f. Slowly downsize the company as the current work evolves and the work load 
permits.

g. Continue to develop engineering services for customers, without taking 
construction risks, but taking advantage of our reputation for due diligence 
and risk mitigation.  I think this effort could fit well inside EES as 
another service provided by Enron.

h. Continue EECC's initiative to develop an E-commerce revenue stream, 
currently being undertaken in coordination with Enron Networks, but relying 
on EECC's intellectual capital, lessons learned and contacts in the 
industry.  I think we have good potential for this opportunity, which is 
actively underway.

In summary, EECC's assets are the intellectual capital of its people and the 
collective systems and procedures it has developed.  Both can continue to 
provide value to Enron inside EES.  I've been discussing details with Lou and 
Joe, but I strongly recommend we agree on a clearly defined plan and allow me 
to communicate it to our employees.

Dr Kenneth L. Lay
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
ENRON CORPORATION

Dear Dr Lay,

While it appears that the US economy is moving towards the much-talked
about 'soft-landing', there are nevertheless imbalances - particularly the
severe shortage of labor and surging trade deficit - which have given
global business leaders reason to be wary. Add to this scenario the new
political landscape, and the recent hike in oil prices, and there is every
reason to pay close attention to the USA in early 2001.

Taking place within the first 100 days of the new Administration, the USA
Meeting 2001 will bring together key members of the cabinet and
congressional leadership, several hundred chief executives from over forty
countries, as well as renowned experts and media leaders. In our usual
Davos-style interactive discussions, we will analyse the current state of
the world's largest market against the backdrop of the global economy.

Held in collaboration with the National Chamber Foundation, the USA Meeting
takes place at the headquarters of the US Chamber of Commerce, across from
the White House. The Meeting is widely recognised as the premier Washington
event for business leaders from the United States and around the world.

A full brochure will be sent to you after the election but wanted to take
the opportunity to inform you at this early stage so you can already block
April 4-5, 2001 on your agenda. I hope that I will have the pleasure of
welcoming you in Washington, DC next April, and look forward to hearing
from you soon.

Humbert-Droz at (41 22) 869 1442 or e-mail: usameeting@weforum.org. You may

credited to your fundraising efforts.
Secondly, I've been doing a little more research on
the elusive Discover Communications, INC., my personal
dream company.
They are owned by: Liberty Media Corporations, Cox
Communications, Advance/ Newhouse Communications and
John S. Hendricks (who is the founder, Chairman and
CEO). If you know of any of the above companies or any
possible contact, I would greatly appreciate your
assistance. I am sending my resume to the Discover HR
people, but there are very few job postings and
anything I might be able to do to distinguish myself,
beyond of course my incredible experience, charm and
good nature, would be helpful!
Thanks Dad!
Love,
Elizabeth

THE LAST MILE TO ... SOMEWHERE?
By Tim Laseter, Martha Turner, Anne Chung, and Pat Houston

New York, Oct 17, 2000- Last week's announcement that the Web-based e-tailer 
and delivery service Urbanfetch was discontinuing its business-to-consumer 
operation came as no surprise to us. As we pointed out in the August issue of 
strategy+business, such companies -- highflyers Kozmo.com, Webvan, and 
HomeGrocer among them -- face limited online sales potential, high cost of 
delivery, a speed-variety trade-off, and existing, entrenched competition. 
""We believe the last mile may lead to the gallows rather than to the promised 
land,"" we wrote.

Since that article appeared, Webvan acquired HomeGrocer, Kozmo cancelled its 
plans for an initial public offering, and Urbanfetch closed its core 
business. Are we gloating over our prescience? Not at all. We think all these 
moves are signs of maturity -- and indications that one or more players may 
develop a winning business model.

Subject: Vice President Recommendation

 I am recommending Linda Robertson (currently Assistant Secretary for the 
Department of the Treasury) for the position Vice President and General 
Manager of Federal Government Affairs.  Linda would head our Washington, D.C. 
office, replacing Joe Hillings who will be retiring early next year.

 Linda has interviewed with Ken Lay, Tom White, Mike McConnell and Jeff 
Shankman, who join me in this recommendation.

 Attached are biographical information on Linda and a National Journal 
article identifying Linda among the ""Washington 100"".

 We have conducted extensive reference checks on Linda.  Included among those 
was Secretary Summers who said:

""Nobody I know has the determination she has to get objectives met.""
""Far more capacity to grasp the details than anyone I've seen.""

 On Monday, I will seek Executive Committee approval to extend the offer to 
Linda.

From : Vivek Menezes
To   : Mr. Kenneth L. Lay (klay@enron.com)
       Chairman & CEO,
       Enron Corp.

Dear Mr. Lay,

Further to my emails dated 22/2/2000 & 14/6/2000 introducing Tata Housing a=
s
a premium real estate developer in India, and specifically, our commercial
complex Technopolis KnowledgePark at Andheri (E), Mumbai.  We have been
given to understand  that Enron have acquired an additional space in  Kamla
Mills Compound.  We were surprised to note that Enron did not consider
Technopolis KnowledgePark inspite of it being a ready to move in building
with all the facilities required for a good Call Center.

A few of these facilities being -

_ High speed (100 MBPS)  data network with switched interconnection
      between offices.
_ Provision  for  ISDN lines.
_ 5000 line MTNL  exchange on campus
_ Power from Tata Electric Cos, which is 20% cheaper than the Government
      supply.
_ In addition,  a good quality restaurant and 24 hours ATM facility.
_ Central Air-conditioning & Building Automation System.

All these facilities and more were explained to Mr. Edward de Valcourt,
Project Director Communications, Enron Corp., when he visited Technopolis
KnowledgePark on 16/6/2000.  Inspite of that, we have once again not been
considered.  I would like to take this opportunity to inform you that we
currently have approximately 1,00,000 sq.ft. of space available at
Technopolis KnowledgePark.  We are also in the process of constructing the
IInd Phase in the same complex which is approximately 60,000 sq.ft. and can
be made entirely available to you, if required.

Further, we have another building of approximately 1,00,000 sq.ft. located
strategically at Kanjurmarg.  This too could be ideal for your requirement.
We would also like to inform you that Tata Housing has a large land bank an=
d
can offer properties to Enron for Call Centres  across the country.
We request you to once again look into the same and revert to us at the
earliest.

Thanking you
Yours sincerely,
TATA HOUSING DEVELOPMENT CO. LTD.

I am conducting a review of Enron for TCW's equity portfolios.  You may 
recall that we have spoken several times when you visited TCW for the Board 
of Directors meetings.  Previously I worked in TCW's Latin America investment 
department and have followed Enron's investments in Latin America.  I am now 
working as an analyst for TCW's equity research department.   With the 
encouragement of Robert Day and Leigh Crawford, whom you met with recently in 
Phoenix, I am considering making a recommendation for the purchase of Enron 
stock.

I am writing to you to solicit your help in setting up a visit to Enron for 
Leigh Crawford and myself.  We are interested in meeting with you, Clifford 
Baxter, Jeffrey Skilling, Andrew Fastow, Mark Koenig, Richard Buy and any 
other individuals you believe would be helpful in our understanding your 
business.  We would also welcome the opportunity to tour Enron's facilities.

The date of the visit can be chosen for the convenience of you and the other 
managers.  The week of December 18th and the early weeks of January are 
particularly convenient for us.

Thank you very much for your help and I look forward to learning more about 
Enron.

Fujitsu is the second largest IT company in the world and Japan's largest
        computer manufacturer. In terms of US dollars, Fujitsu is about $52
        billion. Here is a web site if you are interested.

Fujitsu is a large consumer of electricity and broadband. I would like to get 
the executives of the two companies talking.
      I think there are major opportunities for Enron to sell ""stuff"" to 
Fujitsu, for Fujitsu to sell ""stuff"" to Enron, and to jointly

 Portal","Kenneth,

Key Customers, Partners, and Suppliers are your company's most valuable
strategic assets
as they account either for a majority of the revenues (80/20 rule) or carry
significant
investor mindshare.  The problem today is that these crucial relationships
are complex to manage, involving multiple people, systems, information, and
processes that cross company boundaries.  As a result, studies show that
sales teams are spending upto half their time managing day-to-day account
coordination - taking valuable time away from selling.

The question is - How can you successfully foster strategic relationships
while lowering account management costs?

Our CEO faced this problem when managing relationships like these for a
leading high-tech company.  She realized, in frustration, that there was no
infrastructure to manage strategic relationships consistently and
proactively.  There were front-office automation and CRM applications that
improved forecasting, sales support and other internal processes, and there
were personalization applications that pushed information to customers, but
there was no application that provided a comprehensive customer-driven view
of strategic relationships.

So, we developed the Kovair VIPCenter -- a relationship-centered application
that crosses company boundaries and consolidates all the touchpoints in a
strategic relationship (people, applications, information, and processes).

Each VIPCenter is a bi-directional, relationship-specific Web portal that
fosters long-term collaboration and deeper intimacy with each of your
strategic partners, suppliers, and customers throughout the relationship
cycle.

VIPCenter has a unique extensible application architecture. Out-of-the-box,
VIPCenter has
all the core applications needed to manage strategic relationships so you
can be up and
running quickly.  And, it is built on Kovair's patented SRM platform,
providing seamless interoperability with CRM and ERP applications,
enterprise-class scalability, and extensibility.

Simply put, Kovair's VIPCenter allows you to build more intimate long-term
relationships with these key customers, suppliers and partners, while
lowering account management costs.

I have attached a Product Data Sheet, Technical Architecture Overview, and a
White Paper from the Aberdeen Group illustrating the importance of Strategic
Relationship Management.

I know it can sometimes be difficult to understand a solution from a simple
email. For a demonstration, or for more information on how we can help you
maximize the value of your strategic relationships, please contact me at
your earliest convenience. I can be reached at 408-546-2014.

Very shortly after we spoke, I was informed that we had lost the Enron
HomePC Program. This is a great emotional blow to us and I am beyond
disappointed.

We understood that given our recent  strong performance against Dell, they
would do anything to embarrass us in our own backyard.  We have very strong
insight into their intent and knew they would  use this aggressively in
their PR campaigns.

However, clearly it was our job to win the business on the merits of the
individual program and to compete hard for it. We believed that we had a
creative offer on the table that would create great value for your
employees. Obviously, we did not perform to your expectations.

Following is the summary of our activities together which was created before
we heard the news.

I pride myself in developing strong executive relationships with our
customers, and I would welcome the opportunity for us to put our heads
together in order to look for ways we can move the relationships between our
two companies to a higher level.

I also think we should discuss the PR positioning. As a member of our Board,
and as a leader in the Houston community this will be news and I am hopeful
we can find a creative way to balance it.

Again, I accept it was ours to win in the marketplace but regret it had to
come to this. I look forward to your call.

From our Enron team:



* EBS Product and Service Supply Agreement

Compaq will continue to honor the Product and Service Supply Agreement
executed on January 18 between EBS and Compaq, whereby Compaq agreed to
purchase broadband services from EBS (on a take or pay basis) in proportion
to EBS' purchase of NT servers and attached storage.  It is also important
to note that we have been actively partnering with EBS on non-contractual
areas, such as our ongoing technical joint development and marketing efforts
around the Windows Streaming Media product.  I understand that our teams
have been working very closely together -- and with Microsoft -- to resolve
technical issues with Windows Streaming Media and thereby speed EBS' market
deployment.

The major issue is that Enron does not support traffic to many of our
concentration point so we need to be creative.

Bottom line, we are down to solvable problems with solution activities
underway.

* Windows 2000


During the last week of May Compaq responded to a request from Enron to
support Windows 2000 deployments, and placed people on site with no defined
contract or process due to Enron's requirements.  At this writing, no
contract has been signed, and the current contract iteration is at number
fourteen.  Apparently the delivery scope has changed several times and there
have been a few mistrals. Compaq is continuing to provide resources despite
the fact that no contract is in place and will work with Enron to ensure a
successful completion of the project.

* Power Management

Jesse Greene, our CFO, will act as the contact point for Enron for power
management services. The issue is we have existing contracts at favorable
rates but we will break the log jam.

* HomePC Program

For several months, Compaq and Enron have been working the solution to bring
technology and Internet access into the homes of every Enron employee.
There have been many creative discussions around hardware and financing to
allow Enron to fully subsidize the package provided.  Compaq, Enron and
Compaq Financial Services had gotten to a point where the $35 per month cap
was going to require the specifications of the hardware to be reduced.  In
recognition of the value of our partnership and our mutual desire for this
program to be the premier program in the industry, we have increased the
specifications of the hardware while taking significant pricing actions and
financing rate reductions.  These actions will actually allow Enron to
support better than expected hardware with the extended warranty for $34.28
per month.   This will truly be an industry-leading program when launched
later this fall.",LAY-K

Presidential Inauguration.  Enclosed is information pertaining to everything
from hotel accommodations and travel to the Texas State Society Black Tie
and Boots Inaugural Ball, which is the official Presidential Inaugural Ball
for the State of Texas.

Furthermore, I would like you to notice that several of the hotels in
Washington, DC are not taking reservations until November 8, 2000.  In order
to reserve a room for the Inauguration, you might want to begin calling
hotels at the open of business on that day.  You will find a compiled list
of many hotels on pages four through six in the attached information.
Please make a note that most hotels require a minimum length of stay of four
nights.  You will want to plan accordingly.

In addition, I do not recommend that you rent a vehicle during your stay.
Due to the large number of people in Washington at this time, driving will
be next to impossible.  It is in your best interest to utilize the Metro
system or to take a cab.

I hope you find the enclosed to be useful.  Please feel free to call my
office at 202.225.2231 or email Jenny Sheffield at
jenny.sheffield@mail.house.gov if there is anything else that I can do to be
of assistance.  I look forward to seeing you in January!

post to E-think.

The Power Company Name Recognition - Introduce Home Coupons

Make the internet profitable to households.  Newspapers advertise that this 
week's Sunday paper has coupons that will save you $100.00.

Go one step better:

Every household must eat.  Some households buy the Sunday newspaper just for 
the coupons to purchase.  Offer a Enron site where producers can post 
manufacturer's coupons on The Enron B2B web page.  If the consumer downloads 
the coupon, TPC records the transaction including the consumer's logon site 
and Zip Code.  Sell the database to the manufacturer/producer.  Ask the 
consumer if they would like direct solicitations for competitor's brand.  
Expand it to appliances and manufacturer's coupons.

Then Link local grocery/appliance stores, for the consumer, by his 
surrounding zip code.  The stores would post their price for that month's 
coupon by store zip code on the B2B.  For those stores participating, prepare 
a comparison by store also considering double and triple coupon offers and 
the consumer can make a decision where to buy their groceries.  Sell the 
download to stores for expected inventory control.

If it takes off, I think internet volume would be tremendous and newspaper 
circulation??   McClere agreed that broadband won't take off until there is 
some kind of ""killer application"" to drive more people toward high-speed 
Internet access.",LAY-K

Immelt attributes much of his success to his laserlike focus on sales.
""I love working with customers. . . . Sales has really influenced everythin=
g=20
I do. It has instilled in me the important traits of operating with a sense=
=20
of urgency and listening to people,"" Immelt said.
Immelt on Monday was named president and chairman-elect of GE. He will=20
succeed John F. ""Jack"" Welch Jr., GE's chairman and CEO, when Welch retires=
=20
at the end of 2001.
When Immelt landed at GE Medical Systems in 1997, he quickly showed a knack=
=20
for squeezing growth from a unit known for sluggish sales. Last year, its=
=20
revenue jumped 23% to $6 billion.
Customers credit Immelt with going way beyond sales. When Chicago's=20
Northwestern Memorial Hospital expanded its scanning services last year,=20
Immelt spent hours helping to manage its work flow.
""That's the kind of collaboration that we find unusual,"" Northwestern=20
Memorial CEO Gary Mecklenburg told Business Week.
Immelt has proven himself both by turning around troubled GE divisions and=
=20
extracting better performance from thriving units.
Immelt knows how important it is to set the pace, not follow it. To keep GE=
=20
Medical flourishing, he's pushed the unit to expand acquisitions and new=20
product offerings. The division's product line ranges from ultrasound devic=
es=20
used in doctors' offices to multimillion-dollar CT and MRI scanners.
In his earlier work in GE's Plastics division, Immelt stood out by persuadi=
ng=20
hard-boiled carmakers to substitute plastics for metal on some parts.
As vice president of consumer service for GE's Appliances division, Immelt=
=20
deftly handled the fallout from a recall of refrigerator compressors. To ke=
ep=20
workers' morale pumped up during the recall, Immelt would often climb up on=
 a=20
forklift in GE's Louisville, Ky., plant and pass out words of encouragement=
=20
and praise. He took time to speak with employees during such sessions,=20
listening carefully to their ideas and concerns.
Immelt believes that open, fast communication with workers is crucial. Not =

table-thumper, he meets with employees =01) sometimes hundreds at a time =

consensus-building, urging others to understand different points of view.
After returning from corporate meetings, Immelt distills the latest GE=20
thinking on videotape, and copies are sent to offices around the world.
Understanding that seeing someone face to face helps foster stronger=20
relationships, Immelt also travels often to meet employees and customers.=
=20
Constant contact keeps a company united, Immelt believes. So he updates the=
=20
company's employees once a week via e-mail on the latest developments =01) =
new=20
business, lost sales opportunities and other nuggets about company=20
initiatives. E-mail is sent in five languages, and at times up to a dozen,=
=20
according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.
Immelt was one of three GE executives who analysts considered possible=20
successors to Welch. Welch, 65, has been at the helm of the Fairfield,=20
Conn.-based finance, industrial and broadcasting powerhouse for the past tw=
o=20
decades.=20
""Jeff Immelt is a natural leader, and ideally suited to lead GE for many=20
years,"" Welch said. ""He brings a keen strategic intellect, a cutting-edge=
=20
technological background, strong leadership characteristics and a unique se=
t=20
of team-building skills.""
Knowing that preparation is key to long-term success, Immelt has long been=
=20
preparing himself, says Charles M. Lillis, a former GE executive who hired=
=20
Immelt in 1982.
""Starting in high school, (in) everything he did he was a leader,"" Lillis=
=20
told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. ""He played football. He was a student=
=20
leader. He went to Procter & Gamble after college and he did a great job in=
=20
sales. He also had the right balance of self-confidence and awareness that =
he=20
did not know everything.""
Immelt has strong marketing skills and helped create the GE slogan, ""We bri=
ng=20
good things to life,"" in his first job at GE.
Analysts and friends say the 6-foot, 4-inch Immelt possesses not only a=20
commanding physical presence but also the intellectual strength necessary t=
o=20
inspire management and workers at GE. Immelt believes that a consistent=20
approach will give the biggest pay off.=20
He's been with GE practically all of his working life, just as his father,=
=20
Joseph, before him. His father spent his 38-year career at GE working in th=
e=20
Aircraft Engine division in Cincinnati.
Immelt has a good sense of humor and the ability to present himself well to=
=20
both Wall Street and the average worker, much like Welch.
Immelt realizes that humor helps ease conversation, forge bonds and motivat=
e=20
people. He saw that as an offensive tackle for Dartmouth College's football=
=20
team in the 1970s.=20
Immelt wanted to keep football practice fun to keep his fellow players fire=
d=20
up. Immelt came up with gags, including a tongue-in-cheek award for the coa=
ch=20
of the week. He liked to loosen up the team with jokes on the sidelines and=
=20
in the huddle, according to teammates.
Despite the fun and games, his teammates could see Immelt's drive. ""When th=
e=20
rest of us were feeling our way through college, he took it to the next=20
level,"" former teammate Curt P. Oberg told Business Week.
Immelt studied just as hard as he played. He graduated cum laude with his=
=20
B.S. degree in applied mathematics from Dartmouth and an MBA from Harvard=
=20
University.
He joined GE in 1982 after a short stint with Procter & Gamble Co. as a bra=
nd=20
manager. His first job with GE was in corporate marketing. That was followe=
d=20
by sales, marketing and management positions in the company's plastics and=
=20
appliances divisions.
When Immelt took over at GE Medical Systems in 1997, one of his first actio=
ns=20
was to oversee an internal management shake-up.
""He is an extremely capable executive leader, as evidenced by his record as=
=20
CEO of GE Medical Systems,"" analyst Martin Sankey, vice president of Goldma=
n,=20
Sachs & Co. in New York told The Associated Press. ""He compiled a strong=20
record of generating growth and moving into new markets.""
GE Medical Systems has seen profit rise as demand for big-ticket medical=20
imaging and patient-monitoring gear has grown.
""Immelt clearly runs the best business at GE-GE Medical,"" Bill Fiala, an=20
analyst at Edward Jones, told Reuters. ""He's taken it international, and he=
's=20
done a fantastic job designing new products and capturing market share.""
He's a disciple and expert of Six Sigma, the quality movement that has been=
=20
made almost a religion at GE. Six Sigma is a complex, highly statistical=20
quality program that Welch wants as his legacy.
To make sure he understood the program, Immelt immersed himself in the stud=
y=20
of Six Sigma. Relying on his background in mathematics, he worked out=20
probabilities by using solid statistical research.

Dan Eilers of Vanguard Venture Partners contacted me last week to see if 
Enron would be interested in a high level discussion of the changes occurring 
in electricity generation and management technologies.  Vanguard is an early 
stage VC fund that helped create Ciena and Network Appliance.  Dan is a new 
partner and is looking at the energy market as a new focus for Vanguard.  

He would like to have a brainstorming session with an eye on creating a 
cooperative relationship between Vanguard and Enron for the evaluation and 
development of new companies in the energy arena.

I would appreciate it if you could respond with your interest level so I 
could arrange a time that is convenient for each of you to participate.

		 Subject: Energy investing...brainstorming and perspective sharing between 
Vanguard Ventures and Enron...

Many thanks for meeting with Bob and I last week.
How ironic to find you working with one of my 
graduate school classmates, Gene Humphrey.

As we discussed, Vanguard is interested in exploring
what kinds of opportunities may exist for venture 
investment in the energy arena.  We think that
the ultimate ""internet (and everything) infrastructure"" play is about clean,
always on, electrical power.  While we are not experts in the area,
and are not yet certain it will be a productive area for venture
capital investment of the type Vanguard does, we feel 
that there is a sufficient market need in multiple segments that 
there MAY be such an investment opportunity which it
would make sense for us to pursue as an investment
focus area.  This could have value for Enron should
we determine investment areas which are symbiotic
with Enron and which we could collaborate on, as we
help catalyze/create/fund exciting new companies.

As we discussed we would love to participate in a brainstorming and 
perspective setting session with visionary and strategic Enron executives
who
have domain knowledge and an interest. Our potential interest areas span 
from generation (alternatives, distributed, and conventional) 
to transmission to distribution to storage...fixed and mobile.  
We appreciate your offer to pull together an Enron group for such 
a brainstorming...and I would be quite happy to fly down to 
Houston again in order to engage in such a session.

As always we appreciate your interest in Vanguard.

Thank you in advance for taking time to meet with me.

I wanted to let you know in advance the topics I would like to discuss.

Now that I have been at EBS for a little over a year, I want to update you on 
my
progress and experiences within EBS.

The other topic I would like to discuss with you is my pursuit of an MBA.  
More
specifically I wanted to gather some of your insight as to pros and cons of 
this
pursuit and how having an MBA with a technical background positions me within
Enron.

I would also like to talk to you about the outside business interest of mine
that I mentioned the night of the RISE School fundraiser.  This interest
fulfills my entrepreneurial desires and for that matter, I have been involved
with this company for the last five years and am one of three principles.

DATE:??  ??????? September 28, 2000 

??????? You may  have seen that ONI Systems filed today for a follow-on 
common stock offering and  a convertible debt offering.? As a result of these 

financings and the associated activities, attending  the September and 
October Compaq Board meetings would not be possible.? In  addition, as you

know, since accepting my current position at ONI  Systems, the company's 
requirements on my time have made it difficult for me to  be as proactively

involved with Compaq as I feel a board member should  be. 

??????? Therefore,  I believe it is in our mutual best interest that I submit 
my resignation from  the Board effective September 25,  2000.???????? I 
certainly enjoyed  

my involvement with the Board and I appreciate the  Board's understanding of 
my decision.

Subject: Jeff Skilling does MS150




	

Well, the bike is inspected, a few training rides have been made, and the 
camping gear is being dusted off (yes, he is actually camping at the 
fairgrounds in LaGrange!).  Now all our fearless leader (and incidentally, 
the National Multiple Sclerosis Society's 2000 Man of the Year), Jeff 
Skilling, needs is your help in raising money for MS.

Enron's MS150 Dream Team is bigger than some townships in these parts - over 
350 Enron employees, led by Jeff, will ride from Houston to Austin under the 
Enron Flag April 15-16, and the team's goal is to raise $350,000.  I am 
challenging (is begging a better word?) each of you to pledge a certain 
amount per mile - i.e., $1, $2, $5, it's your call.  I'll even give you a 
break on the calculation and use 150 miles, even though Jeff swears it's 
closer to 170 miles (you know how he is with numbers).  Of course, a flat 
pledge is also appreciated.  And don't forget, Enron will match your pledge 
to this very worthy cause 1-1.

I hope you will join the team and help Enron maintain its status as the top 
money raiser of all MS150 rides in the NATION!  Thank you for your 
consideration.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call me.

After our conversation with Gerry Hines at the Aspen Hospital my wheels
started spinning.  If you remember, you mentioned to Hines that you would
have your people contact his in reference to Enron's real estate requirement
in London.  Well, this eager (maybe too eager) real estate broker's juices
started flowing (Papa Duncan would be surprised to know that something
besides Wendy gets me going)!

If you need some quality competition, I have formed a strategic alliance
with Trammell Crow Savills (www.trammellcrowsavills.com) specifically to
pursue Enron's real estate needs in London and elsewhere in Europe.
Trammell Crow Savills was formed in May to create one of the largest and
most experienced full service real estate firms covering Europe,
Asia-Pacific and Australia.  I was able to form this alliance specifically
to go after your business because 4 of the top officers at Trammell Crow are
friends of mine.  Don Williams (Chairman), Pryor Blackwell  (COO), Chuck
Anderson (Regional President) and Mike Lafitte (President Dallas and Blake
Poston's Godfather).  In fact, Trammell Crow is hosting a golf tournament in
October that will raise $70,000 for Rise Dallas!

Mike Lafitte is the only one who knows that Enron is the potential prospect.
So, if I have my nose where it does not belong I can shut it down without
any fanfare.

Could there be an opportunity to meet with Enron to sell Trammell Crow
Savills for your London and/or European real estate needs?

It's a long shot, I know.  But, I had to take a swing!

Sincerely,

John

Dear Ken,

We regret that your schedule did not permit you to visit with us this week
to discuss the Center's Global Change Program.  We do understand that the
White House probably has priority.

Rosalee indicated that you are available to meet at the Center on May 24th.
the day before the Board of Trustees meeting.  May I suggest that we invite
some members of the Steering Committee to join us on the 24th to review
where we are, the political environment, and continued Center involvement
in this program area.  As you are aware we have had discussions with the
Turner Foundation on a Leadership Forum and have developed several projects
which have each received partial funding commitments from the federal
government or private foundations.    Paul O'Neill, Tim Wirth, Bill Miller,
Teresa Heinz and Michael Oppenheimer are my suggestion of Steering
Committee members to join us.  Please give me your thoughts.

As always, Mary Hope

Dear Doug, dear Rosalee,

Please find attached the preliminary programme for the Energy Governors
Meeting.  The programme is based on the discussions held during the
preparatory meeting last month.  We were delighted that Enron was
represented.  Thanks for all you input Doug!  For you information, I have
also attached the list of confirmed participants to date.

Doug, based on your last e-mail, we would like to invite Dr Lay to speak in
the session ""Globalization and Liberalization"" on Monday afternoon.  Please
let me know if you agree and if either you or Rosalee could check with him
to see if he is of the same opinion and if he accepts, I would greatly
appreciate this.  Or let me know if he would prefer to speak in another
session.

Rosalee, we have Dr Lay already confirmed for two sessions within the main
Annual Meeting programme, the B-2-B session and ""The shape of the 21st
Century Corporation""  as soon as I know the exact dates and times - I will
let you know immediately in order to re-confirm.

me to be one of the 35  participants in the Center for Houston's Future. When 
my previous firm closed  it's Houston offices at the end of last December, 
all mail was collected and  forwarded to New York for sorting and 
redistribution. The mail from January that  should have been sent to me was 
apparently sitting in a corner all these months  in the New York mail room of 
Curtis, Mallet (my previous firm), and was  delivered to me yesterday, 
including your letter. You can imagine what my  reaction was to my previous 
firm's management concerning this nine month delay.  I am most distressed, 
however, to have missed the opportunity to participate in  the Center for 
Houston's Future's endeavors, which I most certainly would have,  and am 
somewhat surprised that my failure to respond to such an important effort  
never came up in conversation among us?--- we've been around each other

Dear Mr. Lay,

     Enron's  dynamic growth in the field of energy
during the last three years is truly remarkable. As a
student of business, I am truly impressed by the
strategic acquistions made by Enron in the area of
power and its leveraged arbitrage with the gas
industry.
     I would very much like to make a career within
Dynegy and would appreciate very much if you would
consider me for a Management trainee position in your
esteemed organization. Enclosed is a copy of my

Subject: Azurix and OPIC

Joe
 I want to give you a heads up on a serious issue that has developed between 
Azurix and OPIC. There is no action requested from you but I wanted you to be 
aware of this development.

 Last spring we encouraged Azurix to look to OPIC and IDB for funding support 
for the financing needed for their Argentinian concession for the province of 
Buenos Aires.  For the past several months teams from Azurix and the two 
lending agencies have been moving forward with the expectation that we could 
go to an OPIC Board vote in September for $100 million and to the IDB Board 
in October for $150 million.

 Everything was going along great until last friday.  Early last week OPIC 
had its credit committee review and approve the project, though apparently 
some members were concerned about the regulatory risk associated with water 
projects. (This would be OPIC's first financing of a water project.)   Friday 
AM, George Munoz recieved a draft cable from the US Embassy in Argentina 
providing their assessment of the project and, on the spot, pulled the 
project from Investment Committee and off the calendar for consideration by 
the OPIC Board in September.  Friday afternoon, OPIC staff informed Azurix 
and our office in a meeting that Azurix should be resorting to ""Plan B"", 
implying that the project would not go forward in the foreseeable future.  
OPIC would not provide Azurix or us with the cable. 

 Over the weekend, the cable was formally sent to Washington, though now 
reclassified as a classified document so we have not been able to see its 
contents.  Moreover, the Ambassador has specifically conveyed his directive 
to Washington that the cable is not to be shown to anyone outside of the 
government,   John Garrison has a relationship with the Ambassador but has 
not been able to get the Embassy to alter its position, nor would I think 
they be inclined to do so now given the fact that they could have 
disassociated themselves from the draft on friday but did not.

 On the positive side, the InterAmerican Development Bank has stated that 
they are prepared to consider increasing the size of the B loan to cover the 
additional $100 million.   We have met with the IDB and discussed the 
situation at OPIC; they seem satisfied at this point.

 It appears to me that George Munoz is unwilling to take to the Board the 
Azurix project when a damning cable has been circulated around the government 
even if the substance of the cable is exaggerated, taken out of context and 
distorted.  From what we have learned, the cable containes concerns expressed 
about the regulatroy framework, labor issues etc., etc., but also comments 
from the Argentinian goverment about Azurix and the concession about Bahia 
Blanca and the politics of Azurix in Argentina. It is uncompromisingly 
negative in its tone.

 Azurix is seeking a return of  the $250,000 fee and will withdraw its 
application.

 Hope all is well.  John

Through several forwardings of memos it has come to my attention that you had 
several meetings this week with Sharad Pawar and reached some agreements.  I 
understand that a conference call to generate a strategy regarding our 
approach to Mr Pawar was cancelled and no one is able to explain to me what 
approach  you took or what the nature is of any agreements or accomodations 
that you may have struck in these meetings.  I think it is important that I 
and the rest of the task force be involved in the setting of strategy even if 
we will call on you to conduct any of the discussions and it is clear that it 
is cooperation and coordination is paramount.

Please call or write immediately with a briefing of those meetings and of any 
agreements that were agreed to.  In the future, I would appreciate better 
coordination and discussions on all matter related to Dabhol and to Metgas.  
I am available by phone day or night.

and me -- and Ken if available -- to discuss plans for this group in 2001. My
feeling is that we should review its composition after the election -- we may
lose Larry or want to add a Democrat (Laura Tyson?); we can take a hard look
at who is contributing and who isn't etc.
My agenda would be:
1. What can be done to increase the value to Enron? As I see it we have two
purposes: to create fans of and spokepersons for the company in important
fora, and to enrich management's understanding of the outside world (what it
is like, and how it views some of the problems that Enron faces).
2. What are the likely topics that it would be valuable for Enron to discuss
in 2001, as best we can judge things at this early point in time?
3. What should the composition of the group consist of in 2001, given
whatever we decide in #1 and #2 above.
4. How can we maximize the chance of achieving Ken's objective of attracting
outside guest speakers? Advance scheduling? Fees? And what sorts would we
like to attract?
I am sure there are many other items; these are designed merely to start you
thinking.
Let me start the bidding by suggesting November 29 or December 4, inn
Washington if you happen to be in town, in Houston if that is more 
convenient.",LAY-K

Subject: 2nd Annual Enron/MDA Beach Bowl


Hello, Mr. Lay! Enron and MDA are joining together again to do a 2nd Annual 
Beach Bowl to raise money for MDA. Last year, the event was a great success, 
raising over $70,000.  This year's goal is to raise $100,000, so the 
fundraising benchmarks for all teams have been raised. The money raised will 
be used to further research for ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease).

I have put together a team of Analyst interns (Howard Goldfarb, Rachel 
McPhaul, Nicole Brady, Bradley Aiken and myself) for a second year to help in 
this cause.  The benchmark for the team is the raise $600 (pre-matching), but 
I want to outdo the fundraising of $1400+ (post-matching) we did last year.

I am asking for a donation to MDA to help our team bowl in this event.  
Checks are payable to MDA.

FYI, Enron matches all donations $20 or more. 

The event will take place on Saturday, July 29, 2000.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks! Have a great day!

Mike has suggested that we cut back  board meetings to fewer than the eight 
(8) we currently hold.? In order to  give you some background, Linda checked 
other peer companies and the meetings  range from 6 to 8 a year.? 
?
I think that we can cut back to 6,  however it may be more prudent to drop to 
7 this year and first see how it goes  .? The two meetings that can be 
dropped most easily are June or  September.? 
?
June,  because we have the two day strat  plan meeting in July, and Sept. 
because we don't yet have 4th quarter results  and not a lot of new 
information is available.
?
I think that the board meetings take up   an incredible amount of Compaq 
executive time and energy. I would rather have  them concentrate on getting 6 
or 7 meetings right, getting the company back on  track and? increasing 
earnings.? So, my vote is to?recommend to the board that we  eliminate the 
September '01 meeting.? That is a particularly busy month for  many people as 
exhibited by the lack of attendance we had at this past September  meeting (5 
members).? In looking back, we seem to be able to ""fill the  house"" in June.
?
On the other hand, you all may want to  continue with the number of meetings 
we currently have.? I will await your  reply.
?
Regards,

Subject: Vice President Recommendation

 I am recommending Linda Robertson (currently Assistant Secretary for the 
Department of the Treasury) for the position Vice President and General 
Manager of Federal Government Affairs.  Linda would head our Washington, D.C. 
office, replacing Joe Hillings who will be retiring early next year.

 Linda has interviewed with Ken Lay, Tom White, Mike McConnell and Jeff 
Shankman, who join me in this recommendation.

 Attached are biographical information on Linda and a National Journal 
article identifying Linda among the ""Washington 100"".

 We have conducted extensive reference checks on Linda.  Included among those 
was Secretary Summers who said:

""Nobody I know has the determination she has to get objectives met.""
""Far more capacity to grasp the details than anyone I've seen.""

 On Monday, I will seek Executive Committee approval to extend the offer to 
Linda.

My interests are primarily business development.  Although an engineer by
training, I have been in the business and operations side for the last 20
years.  My main area has been natural resources and energy.  I also enjoy
strategy work, and apparently am good at it, judging by the results from the
international plan I did as the first ever VP, International at Westcoast
Energy.

> One item of note regarding project feasibility - while I ran Westcoast
> Energy's Asia business development and operations, we invested (with
> partners) over $600 MM US in five years with a total staff of 5 (including
> clerical), and a write-off rate of 0.14% of capital invested - possibly a
> record low.   I have good systems for risk review and mitigation, and  to
> screen projects, countries, partners, and  agents.

The next World Economic Forum will be held September 11-13 in Melbourne.  I 
have received information from the Control Risks Group that several 
anti-capitalist and anarchist groups are planning major demonstrations to 
disrupt the proceedings. Like the earlier incidents in Seattle, large-scale 
clashes between demonstrators and police are expected.

If you or any of your staff members are planning to attend, you might want to 
consider your personal security when making hotel and local travel 
accomodations.  Corporate Security can provide local personal security agents 
if you desire.

Any non-essential travel to Melbourne during this time frame should be 
rescheduled.

He speaks of teamwork, discipline and approaching the unexpected with an

I don't know if/where this sort of speaker would be helpful to Enron, but I 
wanted you to know about him.  Volunteer Houston brought him to town, so I'm 
sure they know how to get a hold of him.  I realize he is not a corporate

someone who continues to inspire me to strive further.

I have taken a job as President and CEO of ChainDrugStore.net, a web based

Rob,

In our earlier meeting with Lay, he seemed to want to talk about changes in
the corporate ""visions"" over time. He also seemed interested in exploring the
idea of corporate culture. Both of these themes can be included under the
broad heading of strategic vision and the creation of a corporate culture
capable of pursuing that vision.

Specific questions are more difficult to imagine at this point. I think we
should rely on the general approach taken with Skilling and Sutton: How were
the various ""visions"" that have guided Enron's development been defined? How
were they achieved? What do you see as the key issues that should be
addressed in our history?  Who are the crucial ""cluster"" of people to
interview for each issue? How do you see this project being used within Enron?
I'll bet we can have a very productive hour with these general questions.

Subject: Re: OPIC Reauthorization -- Passed in House 10/13/99  

To: Steve Kean: Steve, this has been a very good week for Enron. The OPIC 
authorization bill was passed by a big margin, the Defense Appropriation bill 
giving the President authority to extend the exemptions on India sanctions, 
success with the Trade Adjustment Act language important to a problem raised 
""recently"" by PGE, good news on Cong. Barton's willingness to consider some 
positive language in the electricity restructuring bill, etc. Yesterday, 
Sudaker Rao called me from the Indian Embassy to read me a letter Ambassador 
Chandra wrote to Dean O'Hair , chair of the US-India Business Council 
thanking them and Enron by name for the success on the sanctions effort. Our 
US WTO Energy Services Coalition grew to 40 members and next week we lead the 
US-Bolivia Business Partnership on its trip to Bolivia to meet with President 
Banzer and others in the Bolivian political and business leadership. 

At Enron, Ken frequently cites the Enron people who involve themselves in 
making things happen. I think the items cited above are examples of what Ken 
says to all of us. Ken and Rosalee are always ready to get involved as they 
did in moving the position letter signed by Ken in the OPIC issue. My group 
did the preparation of the letter and moved it to the Hill in a timely 
fashion. John Hardy working from material prepared by Kelly Kimberly on the 
Cuiba update (the House International Relations Committee senior staff was 
worried that it could be used to support some adverse amendment) preped the 
staff and drafted a one-pager answer sheet. This over-all effort on the OPIC 
issue was repeated on all of the other matters assigned.

It is very rewarding to be part of an organization that constantly works to 
win. Ken's right; people do make the difference at Enron. Thanks to all.

bill will now go to conference and we hope to have final legislation in the

and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") transactions in Lilly stock.  In light of
the complexity of the reporting rules and the potential for severe
penalties for noncompliance, please contact me in advance of any
transaction.  As a reminder, the SEC rules cover all transactions,
including:

-   purchases
-   sales
-   gifts
-   trust or partnership transactions
-   transactions in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan
-   exchange fund transactions

We request advance notification of Lilly stock transactions for two
reasons:

   There are certain times when you should not engage in market
   transactions in Lilly stock.  Routinely, these ""black-outs"" occur around
   the end of each quarter through the time quarterly/annual earnings are
   announced.  In addition, occasionally, we are aware of ""inside
   information"" that may be considered material and we therefore advise our
   reporting persons to avoid open market transactions in Lilly stock.
   While you may not know of the event, the knowledge may be imputed to
   you.  Advance communication allows you to avoid situations that may have
   legal consequences, or if not, at least may cause embarassment.

2.   We prepare for you the required reports of the transaction to the SEC.

If you had any Lilly stock transactions in November, please advise me as
soon as possible.  We will prepare the required reports for your signature
and file them with the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange (""NYSE"").  The
reports must be received by the SEC and the NYSE no later than the 10th day
of the month following the month in which the transaction occurs.  If I am
not available, please contact Jim Lootens (317-276-5835) regarding any
proposed transaction.

If you have any questions regarding these matters, please do not hesitate
to call me.  Thank you for your cooperation.

Gary, 
Least I forget!  On N5737 the other day (11/18) Mr. Lay reported to Bill 
Reddick that when his phone (#2 R/H seat) rings and he answers that it 
disconnects on him.  He told Bill that this is the third time he has reported 
this problem.  I spoke personally with Bill about this.  We checked and there 
is no record of this problem reported recently (we checked back to May 2000) 
on all three Falcon 900's.

Lyndel checked the system and there does seem to be a problem with it 
disconnecting if you pick it up before the third ring.  After the third ring 
it works fine.  That is all I know at this time.  Garrett Av is coming over 
today to check the system.

I know you don't like emails but I didn't want this it slip by.  I've 
discussed this with Ron and John as well.

RELEVANT TO THE NEWS

On October 4, the Federal Communications Commission suspended for sixty days 
two federal rules requiring broadcasters to give candidates free air time to 
respond to campaign endorsements or personal attacks. AEI associate scholar

regarding Atlantic Copper.  Our team met with the senior management from 
Atlantic Copper last week in concert with the London Metal Exchange Week.

There are several hurdles to overcome in structuring a deal to acquire 
Atlantic Copper and a long term copper concentrates supply from FM's 
Indonesian mine complex.   Current contract prices for copper smelting and 
refining capacity are low and they might be a bit unrealistic on price.    We 
suggested a conceptual structure that may work but is 
probably a long shot at this time.   They were interested and requested a 
more definitive proposal, which we will develop this week.

We will keep you posted.

Subject:  Attached paper and September 27 Panel Meeting


Dear  Ken,

     I am sorry to say that earlier this week Arthur Levitt was called to
testify in Congress early on September 28, and he felt unable to make our
session as originally planned. It is my hope that we can reschedule with
him
prior to -- or in conjunction with -- the final report. For those who may
have changed their schedules to make this meeting because of the chance to
talk to Arthur, I regret the inconvenience.

     In deference to your time, we'll go ahead with the meeting from 5 to
7 but not with the dinner.

     Here are the details of the meeting.  Note that the location is
different from the previous two meetings.

                         Wednesday, September 27 from 5 to 7
p.m.
                         McKinsey & Company

                         New York, NY
                         Check in on 23rd floor with Carol
Hubbard, who will direct you to the conference room
Phone: 212-446-8836

     Attached is the draft of our final report, prepared by Tim Koller.
It will be the subject of the meeting.  We will want to gather your
comments
on the following:

                         1.  Do you agree with the substance
of this draft?
                         2.  Are there points that should
receive more or less emphasis?
                         3.  Are there any other issues you
would like to raise?
                         4.  Is there anything else about the
drafting and presentation that you would
like to comment on?

     We will need to get everyone's comments, one way or another, by the
end of September so we can proceed to prepare the final paper, which we'd
like to have ready by the end of October.

     Originally you said that you would not be able to make the meeting.
Could you let us know if your plans have changed and you can now come or
participate by phone?  See below for reply.

               ____ I will be there

               ____  I will participate by phone

                          ____ I cannot make it at all but will

Worldwide Sales & Services team:

My travel report this month spans the Americas - from our operations in
Latin America to those in Canada.  I had many opportunities to visit with
our sales and services employees as well as customers, partners, press and
analysts.  It's really great to have a role that brings me into regular
contact with employees and our external audiences - it's very exciting to
see how the momentum is building around the Corporation.

Latin America has been very successful in its direct and partner
initiatives, particularly in Argentina, where we are now 55% direct, and
Brazil which has 60% direct business.  Our LA e-Business Development team is
making tremendous strides to strategically position our business in the fast
growing Internet space, while opening up new and exciting revenue streams.
In just four months of existence, the team has completed several new
alliances with companies investing in the huge growth potential of the
Internet in the region.  Key alliances in this exciting new ""ecosystem""
include:

Diveo, a provider of integrated hosting and security services, secures
Compaq's position as preferred vendor for this potentially huge customer.
It also allows us to offer critical enabling services that will accelerate
the adoption of the Internet and many valuable services in the region.

We entered a strategic alliance agreement with Artikos, a joint venture
between Commerce One and Banamex, the largest bank in Mexico.  The terms of
the alliance permit Compaq to sell the Commerce One solution to the many
off-line and on-line companies investing in B2B marketplaces.  It also
positions us to participate as strategic partners in new marketplaces being
formed by established brick-and-mortar players.

Our strategic alliance with Terra, a leading regional portal, has begun to
generate exciting new revenue streams stemming from a customer
acquisition/traffic arrangement using our Presario keyboard buttons.  In
just four months of operation, we successfully sent 12 million visitors to
the Terra portal and gained from traffic and revenue sharing arrangements
that form part of the alliance.

Patagon.com - Our first Internet alliance, at a time when few, if any,
companies recognized the Internet's potential in Latin America, continues to
pay important dividends.  Patagon.com has grown to become the leading
financial portal in LA with the help of Compaq technology.  We also are
helping sustain Patagon's growth in the market through a revenue generating
traffic alliance that links our customers to Patagon's portal through our
easy access keyboard buttons.

In the coming months, you will surely be hearing more about these and other
new alliances that are transforming Compaq into a leading e-business in the
region.

Canadian highlights
My trip north yielded not only relief from the Texas heat, but also many
other great examples of progress that contributed to our Q2 results.  As you
probably know, David Booth, a 13-year veteran with Compaq and Digital, was
named President and Managing Director of our Canada operations in May.  In
Q2, the region increased their profits by 88% over Q299 and helped return
CPCG to profitability.  Earlier this year, Compaq Canada launched eStore
operations, and with other direct enhancements, expects to be 85% direct by
the end of this year.  Their Consumer Call Centre is racking up awards too -
both as Compaq Call Center of the Year, and from Call Center Magazine as the
High Technology Call Center of the Year.  Product awards in Canada include:
 - ProLiant server received Computer Dealer News' 2000 Reseller
Choice Award
 - Deskpro PC received ChannelLine Magazine's 2000 ChannelLine
Champs Award
 - Aero/iPAQ Pocket PCs became the first monitoring devices for
diabetes in the world through Charles H. Best Diabetes Centre

And last, but certainly not least, some great wins:  Banque Nationale, $2.1M
for Himalaya systems and services; Province of New Brunswick, $2M for MS
Exchange; Capital Health Region, $2M Deskpro/Armada PCs; Lotto Quebec, $1.5M
for Himalaya systems; CanJet, $1.5M for ProLiant servers; SoftChoice, $800K
for SANs; Ontario Lottery Corporation, $800K ProLiant servers; University of
Toronto, $790K Alpha Cluster; SaskTel, $700K Deskpro PCs; and Atlantic
Health Science Centre,  $500K AlphaServer systems
.

World's fastest and most powerful supercomputer
Today we are announcing that the U.S. Department of Energy's National
Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) has selected Compaq to build the
world's fastest and most powerful supercomputer, a 30+ TeraOPS system
code-named ""Q.""  The contract is valued at more than $200M, and the
supercomputer will be housed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los
Alamos, New Mexico.  The supercomputer will support NNSA's integrated
program of surveillance, experiments, non-nuclear tests, archived data,
modeling and simulation to assess and certify the safety, security and
reliability of nuclear weapons without underground nuclear testing.

The supercomputer will consist initially of some 375 AlphaServer GS320
systems (approximately 12,000 Alpha processors) with EV68 CPUs running in
excess of 1,250 MHz on our Tru64UNIX operating system.  Almost the size of
five basketball courts (more than 21,000 square feet), the system will have
more than 600 terabytes of Compaq StorageWorks storage, and receive onsite
24x7 service and support.  This major win, plus other recent wins (see
National Science Foundation below) are expected to establish Compaq as the
No. 1 provider in the high performance technical systems and servers
marketplace before the end of this year.  A great recognition for Compaq,
the Business Critical Server Group, and the outstanding sales teams!

Our other largest wins this month were:
Alcatel Telecom (France) - $60M global upgrade for billing system based on
AlphaServers running Tru64 UNIX-based NECTAR middleware.  Alcatel builds
next-generation networks in more than 130 countries
BMC Software (U.S.) - Beat Dell and HP for a $13 M desktop, portable and
Professional Workstation contract
The Cabinet Office (U.K.) - Beat Logica and Admiral for a five-year, $32M
contract in which we were named prime contractor to design, build and
operate IT infrastructure. Deal also includes ProLiant servers, Deskpro PCs,
StorageWorks ESA 12000 systems and Insight Manager
<http://newscpq1.inline.cpqcorp.net/article.cfm?storyid=952>
Caixa Geral de Depositos - $11.8M for software installation of software and
support for computing infrastructure

KPMG (EMEA) - Beat CAP Gemini, EDS and IBM for a five-year, $24M helpdesk
services contract for U.K., Holland and France, with nine other countries to
follow
Ministry of Education (Colombia) - Beat IBM, HP, Acer and Unisys for a $22M
contract to deploy 10,300 Deskpro PCs and 650 ProLiant servers in Internet
classrooms <http://newscpq1.inline.cpqcorp.net/article.cfm?storyid=970>
National Science Foundation (U.S.) - Compaq and the Pittsburgh
Supercomputing Center won a $45M contract over IBM to build and manage the
world's largest non-military supercomputer
<http://newscpq1.inline.cpqcorp.net/article.cfm?storyid=926>
Verizon Communications (U.S.) - Beat IBM for a $13.6M desktop PC contract

International Data Corp:  Compaq 'on the up'
If you haven't seen the recent study by IDC, titled Compaq's Strategy: Past
and Future, it's recommended reading
<http://weblib.lkg.dec.com/IDC/JP84G.htm>.  It states simplification, a
customer-centric approach, information access products and a clarified
channel strategy are keys to Compaq's comeback.  Preliminary 2Q market share
figures from IDC also confirm our progress in a number of other key areas.
For example:
 * Compaq led the WW PC server market with 30.2%, more than the
No. 2 (Dell) and No. 3 (IBM) vendors combined
 * We ranked second in WW portables, with 12.8%, up 2.2 points
Q/Q
 * In Japan, we moved up to No. 7 position, past Apple, in
total PCs, and regained our No. 2 server position from Fujitsu-Siemens, with
a 13.5% share
 * In Asia Pacific, we passed HP in desktops, moving up to No.
4
 * And according to DataQuest, EMEA achieved the No. 1 Consumer
ranking in Western Europe with a 13.4% share, growing twice as fast as the
market
For more information about the preliminary market share results of 2Q, or
our final results in 1Q, check the links at

Winning news from Global Accounts
Our Global Accounts team not only wins new business, but also accolades for
its videos and CDs that are used to help win business.  Trophies include two
at the AXIEM (Absolute Excellence in Electronic Media) Awards in the U.S.,
and the Telly Awards for non-network broadcasts, comparable to a U.S. TV
show winning an Emmy.
<http://newscpq1.inline.cpqcorp.net/article.cfm?storyid=968>

Service Provider/.com wins
Data Return, a leading global provider of advanced managed hosting services,
was recognized by Microsoft as ""Global Hosting Partner of the Year"" during
the Fusion 2000 Awards Banquet. The award noted Data Return's ongoing work
with the Windows 2000 team in developing managed hosting solutions for
customers whose applications are based on the Microsoft platform. This
represents a tremendous win for Compaq as well, since Data Return is using
Compaq hardware and services exclusively for its hosting services.

On July 31st, Compaq, Microsoft, Digex and IDC launched a series of Webcasts
to help educate Compaq Field Sales and the Compaq/Microsoft Channel. The
series, presented by a top IDC analyst, emphasized the tremendous market
opportunity within the ASP market. Based on the overwhelming participation
and positive feedback, there is a strong interest in learning more about the
ASP market. The second in the series will be presented September 7. To
register, call 800-289-0579 (outside US 719-457-2550).

Coconut.com, an ASP in the UK initially offering mail and messaging, has
named Compaq its key partner.  The solution, heavily leveraged around our
Professional Services capability, is Alpha and StorageWorks running
Software.com's suite of carrier-grade mail and messaging products.  The
infrastructure will be managed by eBMS.  HP had been working on this for 18
months, and Compaq got engaged the day before they were about to sign the
deal.  Seven weeks later HP was told they had lost the opportunity.  The key
to our success was a partnering approach to help them with their business,
not just to sell them tin.  The near-term opportunity is $5M, with up to
$25M over 5 years.  Congratulations to the UK team!

Great Compaq Financial Services deals
Supply Access - CFS is providing a $6.5M financing facility on Alpha and NT
servers for this service provider, owned by En Point, one of Compaq's
largest resellers in California.  The deal, which displaced HP and HP
Finance, includes a two-year exclusivity agreement.

Avantel - CFS also completed a $3.5M deal to refresh the installed base of
Avantel's existing Compaq desktops and servers in Mexico.  While Avantel is
a longtime Compaq customer, the inclusion of Compaq Financial Services
enabled a complex sale and lease back arrangement for the acquisition of
Compaq equipment, with opportunities for ongoing contact with the customer.

Roundup of Storage news
As you may have noticed from the earnings news, the Storage Product Group
had a strong Q2, with profitability of $179M, up 45% from last year.  SPG
delivered 11.8% of Compaq's net sales, 17.8% of total gross margin, and a
whopping 31.6 % of Compaq's operating income. Other news from the Storage
front includes:
 * A SANworks print ad campaign, directed at corporate CIOs,
started on July 10th and will be running for several weeks. The ads direct
customers to a Web companion page for more information, go to
<http://www.compaq.com/sanworks>.
 * On August 22, Compaq will open a new Enterprise Storage
Customer Center (ESCC) in Colorado Springs, Colo., that will develop and
qualify advanced network storage technologies for complex enterprise
environments and offer training for IT professionals. The Center will
complement the new Storage Networking Technology Center that was announced
earlier this spring by the Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA)
and is currently being constructed by Compaq.  Both centers will be housed
under one roof when the SNIA center opens later this year.
 * The Storage Networks Solutions Business Unit, focused on
providing leading-edge solutions to the industry, has created a Business
Development Team. For more information, contact Frank Orlando, who leads the
team.

Zero Latency and other BCSG attention-getters
What debuted 10 months ago at Telecom99 as a riveting demonstration of
Compaq's first Zero Latency Enterprise (ZLE) technology has matured into a
formal go-to-market program that will be launched and rolled out in October.
Its goal?  To help you identify ZLE opportunities and win deals.  The
Business Critical Server Group (BCSG) has established the ZLE Initiative to
encompass all of our enterprise offerings - Himalaya; AlphaServer with Tru64
Unix and OpenVMS; and ProLiant with Windows NT, as well as storage, clients
and services.  It will differentiate Compaq in the marketplace, generate
momentum for the company, and give us ""first-to-market"" status.  No other
competitor can come close to what we offer.  The typical ZLE deal profile is
high-revenue - $15M per deal - and high-margin, so the payoff is great.
Stay tuned for announcements in October, including info on ZLE customers;
cool new offerings incorporating platforms, partners and services; new
demos; go-to-market tools to help you tell the ZLE story; ZLE expertise to
assist with your accounts; and press and analyst proof points to help you
sell.  I encourage you to learn more about ZLE so you can leverage its
revenue potential.  For more information, contact your BCSG region drivers.

Other highlights from BCSG:
 * Congratulations to the Tandem BU for its Q2 performance, the
second highest in revenue for the BU in Compaq history.  In addition, the
S74 series had the fastest ramp in the history of the Himalaya platform,
with $69M in S74000 processors shipped since its May launch.
 * MUZO, a Czech payment authorization agency and long-time
customer, will migrate to the most powerful of the Himalaya servers, the
S74000, for its new authorization center opening in 1Q01.  MUZO provides
ATM/POS authorization and back-office services using Base24 from partner
ACI.  The order is important for Compaq in the Czech Republic because it
positions the platform firmly in the country and demonstrates the success of
the ongoing efforts of the Czech subsidiary to build local Himalaya
resources and skills.
 * The ""Dream Machine"" roadshow, which showcases the
AlphaServer GS160 server running OpenVMS Galaxy, is starting its North
American tour. One of its first stops was in Boston in late July, where it
received an enthusiastic response from the Compaq Board of Directors.
 * Recently named a partner for Oracle's iHost applications
hosting initiative, Nupremis is the first service provider to announce that
it will host Oracle iHost applications on AlphaServers running Tru64 UNIX in
its data centers to provide the most scalable and highly available platform
for e-business.

Great things happening in the Consumer world
* In 1Q, Compaq surpassed Packard Bell as the US installed base market
share leader for the first time, according to Media Metrix.  The number of
Compaq PCs in US homes has increased 260% to 5.4 million from 1997 through
1Q.
* Presario portable PCs maintained their No. 1 U.S. retail sales share
in June for the 22nd consecutive month, according to NPD Intelect
* The Presario 1200XL-110 was rated a Best Buy and No. 1 Budget
notebook by PC World magazine
* The Presario 1800T was rated the No. 5 Power notebook by PC World
magazine
* Compaq's 2Q consumer PC sales in Malaysia were up over 1,200%, due
largely to Compaq's kiosk strategy there.  The kiosks have been successful
enough to be featured in the Far East Economic Review
* Compaq beat out four other PC manufacturers to partner with
specialty retailer Eddie Bauer on special edition Presario 1400 series
portable PCs

Joint news from Consumer and CPCG
By now I'm sure you've read about the exciting new additions to the iPAQ
family of products and services, announced jointly by Mike Larson and Mike
Winkler in New York on August 15.  The announcement symbolizes the growing
convergence of the commercial and consumer markets, and the mutual desire
for information and Internet access by our customers.

In addition, CPCG deserves special congratulations on their outstanding 2Q
results - returning to profitability one quarter ahead of what was expected!
All regions were profitable, contributing to the total $63M in operating
profit.  The group achieved the best portable shipment quarter on record,
shipped the 100,000th iPAQ desktop, and the iPAQ Pocket PC demand is 10
times the initial forecast!  And by the looks of all the commercial products
wins listed in this report, the momentum is continuing.  For an interesting
Q&A by CNET News.com with Mike Winkler on the group's achievement, see:
<http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-201-2375731-0.html>

New ISSG product announcements and recognition
ISSG has been busy with a lot of new product announcements, including the
industry's first high-performance network attached server appliance, the
TaskSmart N-Series, new clustering solutions for SCO, Oracle and Microsoft.
More news includes:
 * The ProLiant 8500 is now Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5 Best Performance
on the TPC-C top 10 list.  The Compaq Benchmarks result in a Price/tpmC that
is approximately $10 lower than the top marking IBM number and is using SQL
Server 2000 instead of DB2.  We even pushed the Sun 10000 off the top 10
list.
Check out the great review and double awards for the ProLiant DL360 by
InternetWeek Magazine, titled, ""Rack 'Em Up.""
<http://www.internetwk.com/reviews00/rev071700.htm>

Compaq dominates Commerce One's Global Trading Web portals
Not only do we power C1's own MarketSite.net U.S. portal and all its hosted
installations, but we also power an overwhelming number of its major portal
partners.  These include NTT in Japan, which recently replaced its 30 Dell
servers with Compaq, and Cable and Wireless (Optus) in Australia, that,
after major firmware problems with Dell, is also switching to Compaq.  Let's
be bold about stating our dominance in this market - especially when
pitching prospective business with other trading exchanges.  I'm sure
Michael Capellas won't hold back when keynoting at C1's eLink Conference in
Las Vegas next month where we'll demo our Hosting Internet Buying Program
and BuySite and MarketSiteTM solutions.

NA eBusiness Solutions update
 * Great response since the launch of the speedStart Program,
which provides Web-based resources to start-up dotcoms - 281 companies have
registered, 71 have submitted applications to join the program, and 56 have
applied for leasing financing.
 * The Microsoft/Compaq dotcom roadshows yielded 6,000
customers in 15 cities with 2,533 leads generated - 41% of all attendees ...
222 qualified leads passed onto sales teams or partners.  98% of attendees
rated the roadshows as ""met/exceeded expectations.""
 * The NA Retail Industry Marketing team driving the ACTIVE
KIOSK Initiative has developed a $140M pipeline in the emerging kiosk market
over the past two quarters. This pipeline includes major U.S. retailers GAP,
Sears, Wal-Mart, McDonalds, Kohl's, Belk's, Federated as well as new
entities including Worldmember and eBeauty, representing both pilot and
production installations.

who either have expressed interest in serving on the transition team or who I 
would like to approach to serve on the transition team for Bush.  We believe 
that a call from you to Cheney may be required.

David Haug.    David will be returning from his honeymoon on Dec 4 and has 
expressed a strong interest in serving on the Bush team.
Woody Wodraska.  Woody would like to work on environmental and water issues 
and has been in touch with Bush campaign folks in both California and 
Florida.  He would appreciate a call on his behalf to Cheney.  Amanda is 
aware of his interest and is amenable to his service.
James Steffes.  You know Jim.  He is one of the most creative and talented 
people in my organization.  He is familiar with state and federal energy 
regulation as well as the state and federal policy makers who have played an 
active role in deregulation efforts.  He would be great to have on a vetting 
team for commission nominees.  I have talked to Jim and he is interested.
Others.  We can make another 4 people available from the government affairs 
organization with qualifications in energy, communications and market 
regulation.  The question is more a matter of how many Enron people they 
would like to have.  Among them:  Dan Allegretti (who will be chair of NEPOOL 
next year) who campaigned for Bush in New Hampshire; and Sue Landwehr, a 
republican who works for us in the upper midwest.


Linda Robertson has suggested that we try to put as many people on the

Subject: e-Katz: Chief Kroeker


Over the past week I have heard from many thoughtful and concerned citizens
about their opinions on Chief Kroeker.  About an hour ago, I held a news
conference to release the statement below in response.  I wanted to make
sure you were able to read it in its entirety.

You are a part of my e-Katz list because of your work with me or my
administration.  To be removed from the ""e-Katz"" distribution list, simply
reply to this e-mail with your request.  If you have multiple e-mail
addresses you use, please include a name and/or company, otherwise we may

Statement Regarding Police Chief Mark Kroeker

""I take my responsibilities as police commissioner very seriously.  I have
reviewed this situation with care.  I want to thank those who provided me
feedback either in person, over the telephone or through e-mail.

""The performance of any individual in my administration ultimately rests
with me.  I want to apologize for the concern, pain and fear caused by the
taped comments made years ago by Chief Kroeker.  His taped comments in no
way reflect my own personal beliefs.

""My community and staff discussions, along with reading all the e-mails and
transcripts of all my telephone messages, helped distill my thinking on this
issue to one key question: Can Chief Kroeker separate his personal religious
views from his professional conduct?

""I have determined that he manages his duties without bias and will continue
to do so. His performance has met my expectations.  He is leading the bureau
in a fair, respectful and inclusive manner.  He is moving our law
enforcement efforts to a higher level of community policing.  Therefore, I
have asked Mark Kroeker to stay on as Chief of Police.  He has my strong
support to continue.

""The law provides that all city employees have a right to their personal
religious views.  I have a responsibility to review their employment status
if their actions, as a result of their personal views, impair their ability
to perform their professional responsibilities.

""Many of the arguments raised asking me to dismiss Mark Kroeker because he
is ""out of step with Portland"" could be used in other Oregon communities to
fire more liberal public officials who are ""out of step"" with their
community's conservative majority.  My 30-year fight for tolerance goes both
ways.

""Chief Kroeker will have to rebuild trust with many of our citizens.   He
assures me he is prepared to do so.  He told me he would rather help undo
the damage, help me promote tolerance and acceptance of all people, than
just walk away.

""He commits to a strong and sustained positive dialogue with Portlanders who
are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered, including those on his staff.
He has already begun outreach efforts and will continue to do so.

""He said he will redouble his efforts to promote respect and acceptance of
all Portlanders and be steadfast and fair in his enforcement of the law.

""He agrees to work with the Cascade Aids Project to serve as a spokesperson
to educate citizens about the fact that AIDS is not a ""gay disease.""

""He will continue to seek advice from the City Council, the Bureau's Sexual
Minority Roundtable and others to guide additional efforts.

""He agrees to take all this on with all his heart.

""In the process I hope he and we all learn from this experience.  I will
work to turn this negative situation into a positive one: to expand our
sense of tolerance; to promote the notion that regardless of a person's
personal or religious beliefs, one can be an effective public servant; and
to deepen the acceptance of all Portlanders.

""As Mayor, I will do my part and more.  I hope you will join me.""

 I enjoyed your recent e-mail but was sorry to hear about your dad.  It 
sounds as though his health has deteriorated significantly.  These are always 
difficult times.  As I watched my mother and father's health deteriorate and 
ultimately watched them die, it is a very defining time in our lives.  But we 
can be very thankful to have such great parents and to have had the privilege 
to have been raised in such loving homes.

 Sounds as though Eric has done very well as SMSU.  He is joining an 
excellent company.  I am also delighted to hear that he will continue his 
education working toward an MBA.  As we are living in an age where 
intellectual capital is so valuable, it is important for every young person 
to obtain the very best possible education they can.  As to our family, 
within the last ten days our youngest daughter Elizabeth was married to a 
young man from Buenos Aires, Argentina.  They met while they were both 
working on a project as lawyers in Buenos Aires.  They're currently on their 
honeymoon but shortly after returning will be moving from Buenos Aires to 
Miami, Florida.  This past Thursday night our sixth grandchild was born.  It 
was born to our son David and his wife Courtney.  It was a 7 lb., 10 oz.,  20 
inch little boy.  So we now have three grandsons and three granddaughters 
ranging from about 2 years - 4 months down to a few days.  They are a great 
deal of fun.  We are doing quite well.  I am looking forward to seeing Ginger 
""Rees"" Copeland when she comes to Houston.  I would be delighted to arrange 
tickets for you and your family should you ever have occasion to visit 
Houston.

 I hope you have a great summer.",LAY-K

attached new legislative amendment to provide a limited PUHCA exemption for 
companies with a high level of financial stability as determined by 
independent market analysts (i.e. ""A"" rating for Holding Companies or 
investment grade rating for utility companies).  This is not a permanent 
exemption as PUHCA would again apply should the company loose its high rating.

MidAmerican's lobbyist reported this conversation to me along with Ken Lay's 
reported commitment that we would review it as soon as we could.  Reportedly, 
Ken Lay was non-committal but not negatively disposed.

The utility strategy is to have Senator Bob Kerrey (D-NE) offer this as an 
amendment to a ""must pass"" piece of legislation during the waning days of 
this Congressional session.  This will be separate from the utilities' 
strategy to enact Private Use legislation (H.R. 4971, S. 2967 which includes 
tax language to exclude water and sewage connection fees from gross income as 
contributions to capital and language to increase the amount permitted to 
paid into nuclear decommissioning reserve funds primarily  for Commonwealth 
Edison) and to enact stand-alone Reliability legislation (S. 2071 and H.R. 
2944).

Senator Kerrey has already spoken to Senator Gramm (R-TX) about this PUHCA 
amendment and Gramm was reportedly  non-committal but not negatively disposed 
to the idea.  I will follow-up with Gramm's staff next week after they've 
reviewed it and convey their views to you.  According to MidAmerican,  the 
concept to insure stockholder protection along with consumer protection was 
Senator Kerrey's idea.  

It is possible that Congressman Dingell (D-MI) and Congressman Markey (D-MA) 
would still actively oppose this limited exemption, especially given the fact 
that Congressman Dingell (who would Chair the Commerce Committee should the 
Democrats regain control of the House) has recently said that whether or not 
he is Commerce Committee Chairman next Congress, that comprehensive 
electricity restructuring legislation including PUHCA repeal is ""at least 
three years away from happening.""

Steve and Rick, can we get a temperature gauge next week as to our position 
on this amendment?  As a reminder, Enron's position here-to-date has been to 
oppose stand-alone PUHCA repeal as this is the one provision utilities like 
Southern Company really want.  To date, this strategy has worked with the 
MidAmerican Utility Group willing to support our transmission open access 
provisions in turn for our PUHCA exemption support.

PUBLIC HEALTH vs. THE NANNY STATE? -- Next Independent Policy Forum (10/26/00)
http://www.independent.org/tii/forums/001026ipf.html

Barely a day goes by without some news of the latest public health
""threat."" Serious health hazards, we are told, lurk around every
corner -- in water supplies, air, soil, beverages, fast food,
second-hand smoke, cellular phones, and food irradiation, just to
name a handful. And yet, Americans today live longer than ever! Are
markets and private decision-making providing the answers? Or are
these dangers real, immediate, and a legitimate mandate for
government control? Can we reduce or eliminate health risks without
government dictates? How does politics distort perceptions about
public health? Will Americans succumb to or rebel against the growing
Nanny State's neo-Puritanism and attack on individual choice and
responsibility? JACOB SULLUM and THOMAS DiLORENZO will discuss these
timely and important issues.

SPEAKERS:

      - Jacob Sullum (Syndicated Columnist and Senior Editor, Reason
magazine; Author, FOR YOUR OWN GOOD)

      - Thomas DiLorenzo (Professor of Economics, Loyola College of
Maryland; Co-author, FROM PATHOLOGY TO POLITICS: Public Health in
America)

THE HILL REPORT
A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions
Week of October 7 - October 13, 2000

This Week in Washington, we witnessed a horrific tragedy in the Middle
East. This week's situation has escalated into a sad reminder of
the sacrifice our men and women in uniform make when they report
to duty each day in service to our country. Our thoughts, prayers
and support go out to their families and to all American military
men and women serving our nation all over the world.

This is also a reminder that though we are living in an era of relative
peace and prosperity, America has enemies. There is unrest in the
world and we must be prepared to do everything in our power to find
the people responsible for this heinous act and bring them to justice
swiftly. The world's brokers of terror will know there are consequences
when America is the target of their hate. We are a peace and freedom
loving people and these actions will not be tolerated against our
soldiers or our citizens.

In the United States House of Representatives we passed both the
Defense Authorization Bill and the Agriculture Appropriations bill
for fiscal year 2001.

The Defense Authorization Act, (H.R. 4205) passed by a vote of 382-31
and authorizes $309.9 billion in new budget authority for national
defense activities in FY 2001.  In honoring our commitment to our
men and women in service, this amount is $4.6 billion more than the
Clinton-Gore Administration's request.

Overall, the conference report authorizes (1) $75.8 billion for military
personnel; (2) $110.0 billion for operations and maintenance and
working capital funds, (3) $62.9 billion ($2.6 billion more than
the president's request) for weapons procurement, (4) $38.9 billion
($1.1 billion more than the president's request) for research and
development, (5) $8.8 billion ($788 million more than the president's
request) for military construction and family housing.

I strongly supported the measure and voted for it.  The bill also
provides a much needed and much deserved 3.7 percent military pay
raise and numerous bonuses and other retention and quality of life
programs.

The Agricultural Appropriations bill that also passed this week will
help farmers and producers of livestock and dairy who are suffering
another year of weather and financial losses, including an additional
provision that lifts limits to $150,000 this crop year on Loan Deficiency
Payments (LDPs) and provides the first move to re-opening for agricultural
trade into Cuba.

On Thursday, by a vote of 340 to 75, the House approved H.R. 4461,
the Agricultural Appropriations Act, with the Senate expected to
follow within the week.

Producers suffering a series of harvest losses due to weather extremes
will be able to draw upon funding that provides as much help as possible,
by providing upwards of $1.6 billion for crops - beyond USDA's recent
$1.3 billion estimate.

A prescription drug importation measure was also included in the
bill and will become law as part of the Agriculture Appropriations
Act for Fiscal Year 2001. I hailed the measure as a victory for seniors.

This is great news for America's seniors.  I have always said that
the world's best consumers should not be paying the world's highest
prices. This week we passed a bill to change that.

Currently, seniors in Texas and across the country are paying as
much as 70% more for prescription drugs than their counterparts in
other countries. For example, in 1998, a 30-day supply of ""Prilosec""
cost about $99.95 in Texas but that same 30-day supply was a mere
$17.50 in Mexico.

I strongly support giving seniors more choices in their health care
options but warned that increased choices means increased responsibility.
 Millions of seniors wanted to be able to buy prescription drugs
from Canada and Mexico in order to save money on some drugs.  This
bill does that for them but seniors must be aware of the safety concerns
associated with getting drugs from other countries.

Around Texas...

Tomorrow, I will hold a town hall meeting in Mexia,  and following
the town hall meeting there will be a ""Cancer Society Walk for Life"".
 And next week, I will be in Bryan for a Town Hall Meeting.  See
the notices at the end of this e-mail.

Have a great weekend! - Pete

I called your Dad to tell him about your e-mail and the band.  He is in Vail 
today.  He asked me to call to try to lock in the band, but they have already 
had a call from Linda Kessler, so they are getting a quote to her today and 
hopefully a contract by tomorrow.  I think that is all o.k.  I talked to 
Jennifer.   I'll fax your Dad the e-mail tonight, so he can see the rest of 
it.

Subject: Band

 Dad, & Linda-
Can you go ahead and contact the band, I sent an e-mail to the wedding 
coordinator and she has not responded (she is new to e-mail) and I'm afraid 
we might lose them. Also, she recommended a photographer out of Atlanta, I 
love his work, he does candid more so than the traditional portraits. He also 
did a number of the Kennedy's weddings, etc. I'll try and get a price quote, 
but I might need your help in negotiations. Also, she send some information 
on a decorator/ florist who seems phenomenal, I don't know if Linda might be 
willing to help me out with that as she knows a lot more about both flowers 
and decoration than I do. The Ballroom at the Ritz is pretty basic and he can 
turn it into anything but basic. Also, that we if we find a church that is 
not so amazing, he can decorate that as well. 
The name of the photographer is Dennis Reggie and his number is 404- 
873-8088.  Linda Kessler has all the information on the florist, her number 
is 888 524 1326.
Mom is going to be responsible for the RSVP's for the wedding.  I will get a 
fax machine this weekend. 
Let me know if this is a problem and I will try and arrange some of this from 
down here, it is just difficult for people to call internationally.
I love you!
Liz & Jose Luis

A TECHNOLOGY UPDATE FROM IT'S MARK PICKERING. . .

Sametime, a new communication tool, is coming to screens across Europe and,=
=20
in the future, throughout Enron's offices worldwide.   What is Sametime? It=
's=20
a simple tool that integrates with Lotus Notes to allow you to send and=20
receive text messages to/from Enron colleagues. Sametimeis not a replacemen=
t=20
for email or the phone, but rather it should complement both exiting=20
communication tools. This is a tool that will be of most value to people wh=
o=20
spend a lot of time at their PC, but who want to ask a question of someone,=
=20
conduct a simple conversation or send a message in real time, without havin=
g=20
to pick up the phone or compose an email message.
Sametimegives users instant messaging capabilities. The green square tells=
=20
you who is online and able to receive a message, while the red dot gives a=
=20
simple indication of people who may be away from their desk (see screen=20
sample below).
I use the system everyday and find it invaluable in communicating with my=
=20
team. It also comes into its own when communicating with people in other=20
offices, especially Houston (you can even use it on the road!). A nice=20
feature is that you can fire off a message to someone and know it will sit =
on=20
their screen until they read it.  Sametime'susefulness falls under the=20

  President

SUBJECT: Chairman Savage Honored

Frank Savage, Chairman of the Board of Trustees, was honored on Monday,
October 30, by the Governor's Committee on Scholastic Achievement of New
York State at its annual Robert F. Wagner Memorial Dinner Dance.  Chairman
Savage was cited for his leadership in education and commitment to the well
being of New York citizens.

Since its founding in 1955, the Governors Committee on Scholastic
Achievement has awarded approximately $5,000,000 to more than 3,500
deserving students in New York's public, parochial and private schools in
the form of four-year college scholarships.  Mr. Edward Lewis, Publisher of
Essence Magazine, served as Dinner Chairman.  I know you join me in
congratulating Chairman Savage.

I want to advise you that as of this Monday, Aug. 28, CNBC will begin
displaying all quotes and price changes in decimals (dollars and cents)
instead of fractions.

As you know, the securities industry as a whole is headed towards decimal -
based pricing.  Both the NYSE and the NASDAQ plan to gradually change over
to decimals to comply with the SEC's mandate of total decimal conversion by
April 9, 2001.  By making the full move to decimals all at once, we are
preparing CNBC viewers for this eventual industry-wide changeover.

I welcome any comments from you or others in your organization about these
changes or other aspects of CNBC coverage.   Please let me know if you would
like to be removed from our ongoing notification list or add others in your
organization.

When you click on the link below you will be able to see four summary slides
that illustrate our new decimal-based formats, as they will appear on
Monday, and access a form to provide feedback..

Ken,

I hope all is going well at Enron.  I know you and/or your people have been
discussing with Glenn Yago our so-called Emerging Domestic Markets Project.
It is an exciting one and we look forward to Enron's support, involvement,
participation and leadership.  Glenn will be in touch as the project
unfolds.

Now I am contacting you about our upcoming Global Conference, March 8-10,
2000 in Los Angeles.  There are two issues.

First, I am sure you are aware, we are holding our third annual Milken
Institute Global Conference March 8-10, 2000 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in
Los Angeles. A copy of the program is attached. This year's event will have
a heavy contingent of institutional investors, corporate leaders, and
technology, media and policy people in the audience.  On the program, we
have nine Nobel Laureates, several CEOs of major corporations, and other
heavy hitters.  As you can see, there is a major technology slant to this
year's program.  It will be a great event.  We would love to have some
representation from Enron in the audience.

Second, we are still accepting corporate sponsorship for the event.  I have
attached a copy of our Sponsorship Opportunities brochure that describes the
various levels ($10K - $100K), and the benefits of each sponsorship tier.
This is a great program to be associated with - both high-quality speakers
and a prestigious audience.  Mike Milken and I hope to be able to count on
your organization for support.

We anticipate a global audience of 1,500 - senior people from the financial
sector, business, technology, academia, the policy community and all the
major media.  In just two years, our Global Conference has become a
significant and influential gathering for discussion, debate and networking
on key business, economic, financial and policy questions.

I hope we can count on you.

Paul and I met with Frank Savage, President & CEO of Alliance Capital
Managment International in NY today to see if he might be a good
prospect for the RFF Board.  Ken Lay arranged the meeting - Ken is on
the board of Howard University (where Frank is chair) and Frank is on
the Enron board.  Frank also knows Linda and John Deutch (from the
Council on Foreign Relations.)

We had a very good meeting - brought him upto speed on RFF and how we
are trying to expand our visability,esp in NY and in the financial
community, through events, the Council, etc.  Frank was very receptive
to our plans, thought we needed to focus on specific topics of interest
to the financial community and actions we could ask people to help
with.  He said he would love to come to Dod's breakfast in Feb.and
learn more about RFF.

Howard U. is clearly his biggest passion.  We need to send a letter
from Paul to him documenting previous conversations Paul has had with
folks at Howard about our fellowship programs and our desire to have
more African Americans apply.  He will show it to the President and
encourage him to act on it.)

Next step: Lesli ask Ken Lay to call Frank, see what he thought of us,
tell him more about his involvemnt on the Board, and see if Frank might
want to consider the Board over the next couple of months.",LAY-K

Subject: New PUHCA Exemption Legislative Language

Yesterday, Ken Lay spoke with MidAmerican CEO David Sokol regarding the 
attached new legislative amendment to provide a limited PUHCA exemption for 
companies with a high level of financial stability as determined by 
independent market analysts (i.e. ""A"" rating for Holding Companies or 
investment grade rating for utility companies).  This is not a permanent 
exemption as PUHCA would again apply should the company loose its high rating.

MidAmerican's lobbyist reported this conversation to me along with Ken Lay's 
reported commitment that we would review it as soon as we could.  Reportedly, 
Ken Lay was non-committal but not negatively disposed.

The utility strategy is to have Senator Bob Kerrey (D-NE) offer this as an 
amendment to a ""must pass"" piece of legislation during the waning days of 
this Congressional session.  This will be separate from the utilities' 
strategy to enact Private Use legislation (H.R. 4971, S. 2967 which includes 
tax language to exclude water and sewage connection fees from gross income as 
contributions to capital and language to increase the amount permitted to 
paid into nuclear decommissioning reserve funds primarily  for Commonwealth 
Edison) and to enact stand-alone Reliability legislation (S. 2071 and H.R. 
2944).

Senator Kerrey has already spoken to Senator Gramm (R-TX) about this PUHCA 
amendment and Gramm was reportedly  non-committal but not negatively disposed 
to the idea.  I will follow-up with Gramm's staff next week after they've 
reviewed it and convey their views to you.  According to MidAmerican,  the 
concept to insure stockholder protection along with consumer protection was 
Senator Kerrey's idea.  

It is possible that Congressman Dingell (D-MI) and Congressman Markey (D-MA) 
would still actively oppose this limited exemption, especially given the fact 
that Congressman Dingell (who would Chair the Commerce Committee should the 
Democrats regain control of the House) has recently said that whether or not 
he is Commerce Committee Chairman next Congress, that comprehensive 
electricity restructuring legislation including PUHCA repeal is ""at least 
three years away from happening.""

Steve and Rick, can we get a temperature gauge next week as to our position 
on this amendment?  As a reminder, Enron's position here-to-date has been to 
oppose stand-alone PUHCA repeal as this is the one provision utilities like 
Southern Company really want.  To date, this strategy has worked with the 
MidAmerican Utility Group willing to support our transmission open access 
provisions in turn for our PUHCA exemption support.

Thanksgiving was as wonderful as ours. Jon Christopher, Mike, Nina, and
Elizabeth were here ( Columbia) for Thanksgiving. As usual, we talked, ate,
and enjoyed each other. It has become a family tradition to go to
Shakespeares Pizza, Ernies (ERNWAS) Steakhouse, and Booches (Hamburgers)
everytime any family member comes. Nina cooked some Russian quisine. The
weather was fairly decent for Missouri Thanksgiving (dry, 30 - 50 F).
Elizabeth saw Rugrats in Paris. Dalmations , and went to the parks. We
stayed behind and did other things including watching ""Hurricane"", a very
powerful movie.  Today we have been taking care of all those errands and
routines that are necessary after a weekend of company. We had a good time.


I talked to Ruby last evening. She has probably telephoned both of you by
now. She is sending some cookies to all of us, mostly using Mother's
recipes. How thankful I am to still have her.  And she seems to be in good
health. She is always so positive. She says that the second week in August
is probably the best weekend for the family reunion at our place in Crane
next year.  That would be August 11. How would that be for the two of you?
It would be fine with us. If you are in agreement I will send out the
invitations soon. If not, let me know so I can change it as you are two
important people for us and for the whole family.

We will be going to Thailand on February 5 and returning on March 4. I will
give you all numbers etc where we can be reached. We will have an apartment
in Bangkok but will be all over the Country. Karl and Ila Kruse will be with
us for two weeks. We are really looking forward to it.

Ken and Linda, we really enjoyed seeing you in Columbia. As usual you were
at your  best.

Sharon, We are having our usual big Christmas party on December 23. Any
chance you would be coming to Columbia? We would sure love to have you if
you
 can.
Ken We discussed getting together in Dec. That may not be possible because
of all of our schedules. If not lets look at jAN. For both of you, what does
your schedule look like?
Thats all for now. Let me know about the family reunion date (Sat, Aug. 11)
as soon as possible. Talk to you soon. Love. Bonnie",LAY-K

Subject: Dinner with V. Fox

Dear Ken,
 Federico Sada, who is travelling with President elect Vicente Fox in South 
America, called me this morning, 
and asked me to give you the confirmed list of attendees to the dinner in New 
York, Wednesday August 23, 8:00 P.M.
at the Watteau Room of the St. Regis Hotel:

 Sanford I. Weill   Citigroup, Inc.   Chairman and CEO
 Hendrick Verfaille  Monsanto Co.   President and CEO
 William B Harrison, Jr.  Chase Manhattan Corp.  Chairman and CEO
 Raymond V. Gilmartin  Merck and Company, Inc. Chairman and CEO
 Michael Armstrong  AT&T    Chairman and CEO
 Stephen M. Wolf  US Airways   Chairman and CEO
 Kenneth L. Lay   Enron Corp.   Chairman and CEO

Pending confirmation
 Douglas A. Warner III  J.P. Morgan   Chairman

According to Federico, if there is any late cancellation, no one will be 
substituted. Also, there is a small possibility that
the dinner could take place in Washington, rather than N.Y., based on Fox's 
meeting with President Clinton; they are still
working on the final agenda. 
 
 Max and myself are working on the background information that you will need, 
and will keep you posted of any 
changes; best regards,  jaime____

PASS THIS ON TILL IT REACHES EVERYONE BY ELECTION TIME

Our Senators and Congressmen don't pay in to Social Security, and, of
course, they don't collect from it.The reason is that they have a
special retirement plan that they voted for themselves many years ago.
For all practical purposes, it works like this:

When they retire, they continue to draw their same pay, until they die,
except that it may be increased from time to time, by cost of living
adjustments. For instance, former Senator Bradley, and his wife, may be
expected to draw $7,900,000, with Mrs.. Bradley drawing $275,000 during
the last year of her life. This is calculated on an average life span
for each. This would be well and good, except that they paid nothing in
on any kind of retirement, and neither does any other Senator or
Congressman.

This fine
retirement comes right out of the General Fund: our tax money. While we
who pay for it all, draw an average of $1000/month from Social Security.
Imagine for a moment that you could structure a retirement plan so
desirable that people would have extra deducted so that they could
increase their own personal retirement income. A retirement plan that
works so well, that  Railroad employees, Postal Workers, and others who
aren't in it, would clamor to get in. That is how good Social Security
could be, if only one small change were made. That change is to jerk the
Golden Fleece retirement out from under the Senators and Congressmen,
and put them in Social Security with the rest of us. Then watch how fast
they fix it. If enough people receive this, maybe one or some of them
along the way,  might be able to help.

How many can YOU send it to ??

On page 2 of the document, in the verbiage following item (iii), the 8th line 
of copy which reads as follows:

 (X) the reported last sale price of the Common Stock on the Nasdaq National

Should read as follows:

(X) the reported last sale of the Common Stock on The New York Stock Exchange

When we receive all of the completed Underwriters Lock-up Agreements, we plan

Ministerial sessions scheduled for 15-16 May here in Paris.  The schedule is
as I sent it to you in April -- although there may be some changes with the
events at the Ministerial dinner.  Here, while we are still intending that
Mr. Lay provide a summary of the FORUM session to the ministerial
participants, we may need to re-order the dinner agenda slightly to
accommodate Secretary Abraham's schedule.  We will keep you posted.

I would also appreciate receiving a copy of the CV that you sent to the OECD
for our own files; we are trying to compile a full set of all participants
for use during the sessions.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best wishes,

By the way, with respect to AZX, I have been thinking of ways of
financing water analogously to mortgage debt securitization.  Since
water in fact is a scarce resource, either due to the availability or
infrastructure for deliver, perhaps water ""value"" can be tiered with
different risk/reward relationships per each tier.  Just a thought.

Subject: Forum Topic - HALFTIME & BEYOND



Just a few notes to give some thought to before attending our meeting this 
evening.






HALFTIME - an interval in a person's life where he or she explores ways to 
transform their success into significance.



What is it that you have always wanted to do?  And why haven't you done it 
yet?






HALFTIME DRILL:

 Answer the following questions to help you take stock of your first half as 
you prepare for a better second half.  Be honest, and write down your answers.

1) What do I want to be remembered for? Write a description of how your life 
would look if it turned out just the way you wished.

2) What about money?
How much is enough?
If I have more than enough, what purpose do I serve with the excess?
If I have less than enough, what am I willing to do to correct that?

3) How am I feeling about my career now?
Is this what I want to be doing with my life ten years from now?

4) Am I living a balanced life?
What are the important elements in my life that deserve more time?

5) What is the primary loyalty in my life?

6) Where do I look for inspiration, mentors and working models for my second 
half?

7) Peter Drucker says that two important needs are self-realization and 
community.  On a scale of 1-10 (10 being the highest), how am I doing in 
these areas?

8) Draw a line that describes the ups and downs of your life.  Or draw three 
lines, one for personal life, one for family life, and one for work life.  
Where do they intersect?  Where do they diverge?

9) Which of the following transition options seems to fit my temperament and 
gifts best?
(Evaluate each option on a sale of 1-10)
a. Keep on doing what I already do well, but change the environment.
b. Change the work, but stay in the same environment.
c. Turn an avocation into a new career.
d. Double-track (or even triple-track) in parallel careers (not hobbies).
e. Keep on doing what I'm doing, even past retirement age.

10) What do I want for my children?

Karen

Here it is!

Plenty of good Houston input here as well as Europe.

An excellent general article has resulted; nice pictures too.  I'll get some 
original copies couriered over to you asap.

We are organising bi-lingual reprints.  Please let Iona know how many you'd 
like.

Thanks

Andrew
